              body: >
                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the
                root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and
                device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which
                probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor
                        api port` and

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful
                        firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling
                        is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT,
                        so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

                        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the

                        sync-debug.js.


                        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush
                        process

                        with the supervisor on a device.

                        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build

                        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the
                        automation tools

                        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml
                        file.


                        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed
                        moving forward, and were

                        only to enable livepush builds.

              body: >
                When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks
                whether the

                device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed
                in the

                kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it
                creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes
                as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

                ppp version is 2.4.7. Without defining the right path, the path
                defaults

                to v2.4.5 in NM configure scripts.


                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with
                reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5
                misleading

                some debug effort

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond
                this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce
                unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              hash: b4122eeea971dfc9325885cc7c896c733cf60920
              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the
                timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The
                default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS
                requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only
                applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the
                normal

                functionality.

              hash: 4a47b9297b37277a9aece0ea322e706dbe473f12

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                Reports indicate that NetworkManager can leave stale temporary
                files on

                the state partition that over time can affect the device's
                operability.


                This commit removes the timestamps.XXXXXX and seen-bssids.XXXXXX
                files on

                startup to avoid this situation.


                Fixes #1747

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                udev initialization.

                Building it as module ensures that dummy

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the
                system

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena
                daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container

                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly
                but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For
                example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and
                will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.
