              hash: e91e64315c06327d4592ad4c9d72658ae88c4fba
              body: >
                At this moment tpm_nvram_store_passphrase checks whether the
                expected

                policy is currently met or not, and acts differently in each
                case.

                If the policy doesn't match, the TPM write is protected by a
                one-time

                password that is lost when the function exits.

                If the policy matches, it will be used to protect the write
                directly.

                The latter seems to be broken at least in some scenarios
                (retrying

                HUP after a rollback).


                This patch removes the special-casing and makes

                tpm_nvram_store_passphrase always use the password protection.
                While

                using the current PCR states directly is a nice optimization,
                always

                using the password is more universal and makes the code simpler.

                NVRAM"
              hash: ce2a7d309a5637dc8f5f17d1106fc925f00a898e
              body: >
                At this moment migrating from passphrase encrypted in the EFI
                partition

                to passphrase stored in TPM NVRAM is a one way operation.

                The signed-update HUP hook will move the passphrase to TPM NVRAM

                and protect it with a new policy, but doesn't update the
                encrypted

                file in the EFI partition. That way, if the new OS doesn't work

                and triggers a rollback, the passphrase can't be decrypted when
                running

                the "old" hooks and rollback fails, leaving the system

                in an inconsistent state.


                This patch makes the signed-update hook re-encrypt the
                passphrase

                and update it in the boot partition one last time during the
                migration.

                * If HUP goes through, the encrypted file is removed from the
                boot
                  partition and the system sticks with NVRAM only.
                * If HUP fails, the system can rollback and the "old" OS version
                  is able to decrypt the passphrase without involving NVRAM.

                It's worth noting that both the RSA key and the NVRAM slot are
                protected

                by the same policy, so the "old" OS will be allowed to access

                the passphrase in the TPM NVRAM, even though there is no OS
                tooling

                that would know how to do that. And the "new" OS will be allowed

                to decrypt the passphrase in the EFI partition until it's
                removed

                by rollback-health, even though it will prefer to use NVRAM.

                At this moment securityfs is not mounted in the initramfs,

                so when flasher is running from the migrate script, it won't
                find

                the TPM event log. This is fine for most systems, but on systems

                that have extra TPM events logged and measured, the expected
                PCR7

                value will be computed incorrectly.


                This patch mounts securityfs before running flasher from the
                migrate

                script.

                By introducing the option to whitelist or ignore extra events in
                PCR2,

                we have changed the default behavior of the system. Instead of
                copying

                the contents of PCR2 during provisioning, we now expect no
                drivers

                to be loaded, unless there was an explicit opt-in through
                config.json.

                This is the behavior that we've seen on physical hardware,
                however

                qemu behaves differently - it loads the PXE driver for the
                network card

                unconditionally, even if secure boot is enabled and the driver

                has not been whitelisted.


                This patch makes all the testsuites opt-in for the PCR2
                whitelist,

                which is just a workaround to restore the previous behavior and
                unblock

                the automated testsuite.


                A proper fix should either be in leviathan, or in QEMU, or
                implementing

                a proper test for the PCR2 feature, that checks all the possible
                states.

                        In a target release where the only change is the
                        addition or removal

                        of a custom ipam config, the Supervisor does not
                        recreate the network

                        due to ignoring ipam config differences when comparing
                        current and target

                        network (in network.isEqualConfig). This commit
                        implements the addition of

                        a network label if the target compose object includes a
                        network with custom

                        ipam. With the label, the Supervisor will detect a
                        difference between a

                        network with a custom ipam and a network without,
                        without needing to compare

                        the ipam configs themselves.


                        This is a major change, as devices running networks with
                        custom ipam configs

                        will have their networks recreated to add the network
                        label.

                        The previous behavior required that dependencies were running beefore
                        starting the dependent service. This made it that services dependent on
                        a one-shot service would not get started and goes against the default
                        docker behavior.

                        Depending on a service to be running will require the implementation of
                        [long syntax depends_on](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#long-syntax-1) and the condition
                        `service_healthy`.

                      hash: bdbc6a4ba4766f9466891497bc02bd33aff1d4c7

                        We have observed that even when setting the socket timeout on the
                        state poll https request, the timeout is only applied once the socket is
                        connected. This causes issues with Node's auto family selection (happy
                        eyeballs), as the default https timeout is 5s which means that larger
                        [auto select attempt timeout](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/net.html#netgetdefaultautoselectfamilyattempttimeout) may result in the socket timing out before all connection attempts have been tried.

                        This commit sets a different https Agent for state polling, with a
                        timeout matching the `apiRequestTimeout` used for other request events.

              hash: a059180c9ae5dd4551fd977871fa5a54981b53f2
              body: >
                There are cases when at the end of the flashing procedure the
                board will execute

                "shutdown -h now" but sometimes the shutdown procedure is not
                immediate and the script will

                continue with the next instruction which is to use SysRq and on
                some hardware this can happen

                right when the previous shutdown command is still running in the
                background and the effect will

                be that the board does not actually power off in the end (eth
                carrier is still on, the power

                circuitry is still online and so on.)


                To fix this we sleep for 5 seconds to give the system a chance
                to properly shutdown. If it has

                not been shutdown in 5 seconds then most likely shutdown is
                broken so we force it via SysRq.

                but forgot to update a

              hash: 467089bfa746cf9801ac137c76aa47e2e8b69989
              body: >
                At this moment flasher tries multiple methods to shut down or
                reboot

                the device after it has finished. The current approach first
                tries

                a graceful way, e.g. `poweroff`, and checks the exitcode.

                If the command exits with a non-zero status, it then adds a `-f`
                flag

                to force the behavior. But this doesn't work inside the
                initramfs,

                because the busybox variant of the commands exits with 0 and
                does

                nothing (it will register the signal, but only shutdown / reboot

                after the last initscript has been executed). Additionally,

                the systemd variant of the tools, used on fully booted systems,

                never returns to shell, so there is no point checking the
                exitcode.


                This patch makes flasher use the forced variant if the graceful

                attempt returned to shell, regardless of the exitcode.

              hash: 174d17a1789ba7bf3245b61bc768f1c70929ad73

                Currently we are using /dev/fd/1 as output file for tools that
                do not

                normally allow using stdout. This works on a fully running
                system,

                but the /dev/fd symlinks do not exist in the intramfs. This
                breaks

                the migrator when provisioning secure boot systems.


                This patch replaces /dev/fd/1 by /proc/self/fd/1 which is
                semantically

                the same, but does exist even in the initramfs.

              hash: 9b7f1438dba338c6814ac3dc204df86fd75c36ea
              body: >
                One of the things that balena-init-flasher-efi does is that it
                copies

                the currently running kernel to the EFI partition to serve as
                2nd stage

                bootloader when secure boot is enabled and the boot partition is
                split.

                Right now it looks for the kernel in /, which works for
                provisioning

                from an external drive, but not for the migrator. The migrator
                copies

                the kernel into /tmp before running flasher, but that directory
                would

                be skipped by flasher, as it is a different filesystem.


                This patch makes flasher look for the kernel in both / and /tmp.

              hash: 892fd4f6083b5dc6248f6a83fcdf60dd2528e5ec
              body: >
                At this moment, if anything is measured into PCR2 (OpROMs, UEFI
                drivers)

                the device will provision, but not be able to boot the first
                time.

                This is because the EFI applications measured in PCR2 need to
                verify

                against `db`, which means they will be loaded during
                provisioning

                (while secure boot is still off), but won't be loaded once
                secure boot

                is enabled. This changes the value of PCR2 between provisioning

                and first boot, which means the encryption keys won't be
                released.


                This patch adds two new behaviors to flasher:

                * By default ignore the PCR2 hashes during secure boot
                provisioning,
                  assuming none of the drivers will work with secure boot enabled.
                * After an opt-in, read the hashes present in PCR2 and enroll
                  them into `db` during provisioning.

                The latter is an opt-in, as we have no control and no way to
                know

                what a UEFI driver does. Since these run at firmware level, they
                have

                enough privileges to bypass secure boot. All we can do is
                blindly

                whitelist everything present during provisioning, which might be
                seen

                as security risk, and the user should explicitly accept that.

              hash: 3711e752054bc83ec869c0bd726157bf7fe8acb3

                At this moment hash-to-efi-sig-list only allows to add hash to
                an ESL

                if the whole EFI application is presented, but this is
                technically

                not necessary. We want to be able to use raw hashes, because

                for PCIe devices using 3rd party drivers, we only know the hash,

                the full EFI application or driver is not accessible to
                userspace.


                This patch adds support to use raw hashes to
                hash-to-efi-sig-list

                and ships the tool with efitools-utils.

                Allow for device type names and machine to differ. Until know,
                the

                device type contract had to be named `$MACHINE.json`, and then
                the

                slug in it could be something else.


                The DEVICE_TYPE variable that defaults to MACHINE for backwards

                compatibility allows for the same MACHINE to build several
                device types

                by passing a different DEVICE_TYPE to the build.

              hash: 0bcdad7ea22ce796b80891824783b288b345fd2e

                Commit 8d9f26fb switched to using the wildcard * char inside
                quotes,

                which makes ls fail to find the intended directory and thus all
                builds

                for older Poky revisions fail. We can fix this by removing the
                quotes.

                This is for use in at least 3 device types - where the customer
                requires a non-flasher image to be available by default via
                downloads, but for testing purposes we need ot use the flasher
                image. This change allows for selecting the flasher image using
                the test_matrix input - i.e image: balena-flasher.img

                All public Jetson Orin based device-types have just been updated
                to L4T 35.5.0,

                thus we need to update the base images to use the updated L4T
                repositories.


                We also add the distro configs for the upcoming Orin Nano 4GB
                Seeed J3010

                device-type.

                image may be used with other carrier boards if they are

                        This was mistakenly increased due to confusion between
                        the timeout for

                        requests to the supervisor's api vs the timeout for
                        requests from the

                        supervisor to the balenaCloud api. This separates the
                        two configs and

                        documents the difference between the timeouts whilst
                        also decreasing

                        the timeout for balenaCloud api requests to the

                        This prevents an image download error loop where the
                        delta image on the delta server is present,

                        but some aspect of the delta image or the base image on
                        the device does not match up, causing

                        the delta to fail to be applied to the base image.


                        Delta apply errors don't raise status codes as they are
                        thrown from the Engine (although they should),

                        so if an error with a status code is raised during this
                        time, throw an error to the handler

                        indicating that the delta should be retried until
                        success. Errors with status codes raised during

                        this time are largely network related, so falling back
                        to a regular pull won't improve anything.


                        Upon delta apply errors exceeding
                        DELTA_APPLY_RETRY_COUNT, revert to a regular pull.

                The /sys/class/gpio interface is bound to be removed anytime so
                let's

                not use it anymore. Instead just make the test set the pin to
                high then

                check its value after reboot then set the pin to low and check
                its value

                again after the next reboot.


                Also, when checking the pin value in /sys/kernel/debug/gpio lets
                search

                for the gpio using the GPIO label instead of grepping for a gpio
                number

                because various kernel versions may offset the gpios with a
                base.

                When signed images are used without opting in secure boot, we
                don't want

                the encrypted mount service to run and fail as there is no
                encrypted

                boot partition.


                This commit adds a condition to the encrypted boot mount service
                to only

                run if the encrypted boot partition exists, similarly to what is

                already done for EFI builds.

                The AWS environment is always tied to the balenaCloud deploy
                environment so exposing this to the device workflows is only
                potential for issues, and no benefit.

                For the time being, the deploy environment will contain
                both the AWS and BC vars and secrets.

                This allows more granular control over which environments are
                used

                for which steps, and avoids requiring a single environment to
                define

                how to build, sign, and publish.


                This is better for security as it allows each job to only have

                the secrets it needs, and not all secrets for all steps.


                We retain backwards compatibility by falling back to the
                original

                monolith environment input for now.

                Keep track of the different machine-image combos being built not
                to

                duplicate fields.


                This allows to have multiple device types that build the same
                machine,

                for example if they have different feature layers.

                kernel

                this we

                temporarily forced builds without cache.


                With the fix in meta-balena
                389054e84c0b1fd382d737c39fb2bb02c2b3e9b2,

                kernel modules are always set not to use cache and this problem
                should

                no longer happen.


                At least during the i.MX secure boot local builds with cache
                never hit

                the problem.


                Remove the setting not to use cache.

                For the first deployment of the S3 download mirror we will
                err on the side of cost savings, and use the mirror as a
                fallback not the primary source of downloads.

                Revert this if we want the benefits of using our own mirrors
                as the primary source, like download speed and no rate limits.

                This change makes the legacy NFS cache mount
                optional, and will not fail the build if unset
                or unreachable.

                Instead, if the NFS is available it will be used
                as a read-only mirror for shared downloads,
                but will not be updated with new files.

                can check this metadata against the equivalent field from
                /etc/os-release to

                determine if the device is already running the latest OS
                release.

                The existing method of using labels allows for
                Actions Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) attacks
                because we do not associate the label with any commit.

                This action requires approvals via reactions on a unique
                comment generated for each workflow run.

                Some device types (generic-armd64) need to run the test

                suites twice for the same base image, once with secure boot

                vars enabled in Leviathan, and once without.


                Rather than run the suites in series, or require building the

                image twice, we can allow the test matrix to define separate
                runs

                for the two modes.

                When evaluating expressions for cancel-in-progress, certain
                parameters may not be available at the time of evaluation.

                For instance, the github.job context is not accessible, as it's
                specific to the running job and not the concurrency group.

                A previous commit added quotes to some of the `balena deploy`
                command args - when $status or $_debug aren't defined, this
                means empty quote gets passed as an arg, making the CLI fail.

                We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

                migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto
                builds.


                As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
                bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

              hash: 625a45b652c332ec5d048caeee7dc25638df8dfb

                The "All jobs" job is used for branch protection
                as it captures the overall success/fail of all
                the test matrices and build.

                However without a unique name we are unable
                to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

                This change adds a single instance matrix
                to the build job and as a result will append the machine
                name and deploy environment in the job name.

                when building + deploying or a private DT , the check to see if the DT is private fails. This is due to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-api.inc#L424 using this function: https://github.com/balena-os/balena-yocto-scripts/blob/master/automation/include/balena-lib.inc#L191 - which uses the jenkins deployTo variable to select the correct api url and token.

                Previously an empty test matrix would cause

                Added an if condition to check for a valid
                test_suite property where applicable.

                        This has been broken since splitting the core from the
                        worker - fixing it enables running tests with a local
                        worker without the VPN, much faster and avoids VPN file

                safe and allowing of more device types, changed the allowed
                variation - still small enough to actually check the value is
                right, but should reduce false negatives

                2.108.6 doesn't exist for generic-amd64. The tests used to still
                work, because we werent acually passing the version to
                kernel-module-build correctly, meaning that it would default to
                the one in the kernel-module-build project. That was fixed in
                4484c59fc924100232cc10303a4636ed0082760a , and now we are
                passing the version correctly, we're looking for a nonexistant
                version. Changing version to match the default.

                A custom template path has originally been added in
                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/3599
                for the iot-gate-imx8. The iot-gate-imx8plus needs
                one as well because it's now using the meta-balena-hab
                submodule.

                This fixes the following error:

                The signed image symlink is not generated before the flasher needs it so we avoid this dependency issue by
                defining a new image type for which the build system will automatically create the appropriate symlink.

                The altboot test often hangs for a long time during the altboot
                test, after the DUT has booted into the old OS after the altboot
                failure - the check to see if the rollback systemd services have
                stopped hangs. This is an attempt to fix that, as I think

                Version 2.5.2 of usb-modeswitch contained a local 0.72 jimtcl
                copy which was used

                when the static version of the dispatcher was being compiled.
                Version 2.6.1 removed

                this copy of jimtcl from the source package so we add it back
                ourselves because it's

                easier to have libjim.a compiled here rather than add a whole
                new Yocto recipe just for it.

                At this moment balena-image-flasher depends on
                do_image_sign_digest

                and do_rootfs of balena-image, but this is not enough, as the
                signature

                symlink is only created by a postprocess script.


                This patch replaces the two existing dependencies by
                do_image_complete,

                which should cover everything.

                        This fixes a regression where dependencies would only be started in
                        order and would start the dependent service if its dependency had been
                        started at some point in the past, regardless of the running condition.

                        This makes the behavior more consistent with docker compose where the
                        [dependency needs to be
                        running or healthy](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/69a83d1303a103d82b05d512baf273244b4dbd94/pkg/compose/convergence.go#L441) for the service to be started.

                        This will make the client look for workers with a "DUT:
                        <deviceType>-sb" tag if FLASHER_SECUREBOOT=1 when
                        starting tests. This is to enable differentiation
                        between locked and unlocked DUTs for device types that
                        support secureboot.

                This is specially useful to prevent devices freezing at boot on
                errors,

                for example when the initramfs fail() is called allowing the
                device to

                reboot and rollback.

              hash: 1ae37ac158b93df836126030abec8c3d3f69d92b
              body: >
                At this moment resin-init-flasher just takes whatever image lies
                in /opt

                and dd's it to the target drive. This is fine for general use,
                but with

                secure boot enabled, we want to perform at least basic
                authentication

                of the image being written.


                This patch gets the image signed at build time and makes flasher
                verify

                the signature against a key built-in the kernel trust store. At
                this

                very moment it fails hard if the signature does not match, but
                this may

                change in the future. Technically we only want to know if we are
                about

                to flash a balena-provided image or not, we might want to
                support both

                but behave slightly differently in each scenario.

                        This config backend uses ConfigJsonConfigBackend to
                        update

                        os.power and os.fan subfields under the "os" key, in
                        order

                        to set power and fan configs. The expected format for
                        os.power

                        and os.fan settings is:

                        ```

                        {

                        There may be other keys in os which are not managed by
                        the Supervisor,

                        so PowerFanConfig backend doesn't read or write to them.
                        Extra keys in os.power

                        and os.fan are ignored when getting boot config and
                        removed when setting

                        boot config.


                        After this backend writes to config.json, host services
                        os-power-mode

                        and os-fan-profile pick up the changes, on reboot in the
                        former's case

                        and at runtime in the latter's case. The changes are
                        applied by the host

                        services, which the Supervisor does not manage aside
                        from streaming

                        their service logs to the dashboard.

                the

                altboot check incorrectly assumes the boot limit has exceeded.


                Make sure the bootcount comparison only takes place if bootcount
                has

                been set.

                Right now if the flashing script errors out the initramfs just
                keeps

                running modules. This is a security risk specially for secure
                boot

                systems as at that point we have an authorized trusted OS
                running in

                an unvetted path.


                This commit exits init if the flasher returns, and also attemps
                to crash

                the kernel followed by an infinite sleep for paranoic reasons.

        by reading/writing in larger chunks, ensure data
        is flushed to disk. This reduces the risk of the
        device not booting in case of an accidental power
        cut during the OS update.

        Also update logging to make use of the os logging
        helper functions.

                The beagleplay is unable to load u-boot from the sd-card

                boot partition if the standard geometry set by mkfs.vfat is used
                -

                that is 16 heads / 63 sectors per track.


                We noticed that using a geometry of 16 heads / 32 sectors per
                track

                make the device to boot from the sd-card, so we make the

                boot filesystem options configurable from the device repository

                to apply this setting.

                        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip
                        from the worker had nested retries that led to 30x5 =
                        150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40 mins in the case
                        the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
                        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the
                        nested retries and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins

                        Tests on GitHub started failing recently because of
                        leftover images from

                        the state engine test suite. This fixes that issue to
                        allow tests to

                        pass.

                        There is a problem where if the multiple jobs are
                        running at the same time, all waiting for a worker to be
                        IDLE, multiple jobs start using the worker at the same
                        time. The reason was that first, the state of the worker
                        is polled using /state - then, after some delay, it is
                        reserved using the /start endpoint. Problem 1 was that
                        there is a delay between checking and reserving -
                        leading to a window of time where another job could do
                        the same thing. Problem 2 is that once /start was used,
                        there was nothing to stop the client from continuing,
                        even if the worker was BUSY. This commit forgoes the
                        /state endpoint, and just skips to trying /start - if
                        the worker is IDLE, its instanly reserved, if its BUSY,
                        the reponse is actually checked and nothing happens.

                Sometimes on NetworkManager restart a new rule for a shared

                is added, but the old rule is not cleaned up properly, so the
                rules

                are just piling up. This patch makes the shared dispatcher
                script

                clean up duplicates if it finds any.

            - subject: "resin-init-flasher: use configuration file to specify post-install
                action"
              hash: 9f9f552d02001cddec262eb5db670946c1380b4d
              body: >
                Traditionally after programming the flasher image would shutdown
                the

                device to allow for the removal of the external device and
                booting from

                the internal storage.


                As more use case appeared, like programming from the initramfs
                when the

                flasher image runs on the same target device it will program,
                the post

                install action needs to support rebooting instead as physical
                access to

                the device to power on cannot be expected. This is the case for
                remote

                migration, AMI VM installs and also secure boot installs.


                The current code just checks for the existence of the `shutdown`
                command

                which is not present on the initramfs to decide whether to
                shutdown or

                reboot.


                This commit improves that logic by defaulting to shutdown but
                allowing the

                configuration file to specify a reboot instead.


                Also, it improves the robustness of the reboot/shutdown by
                falling down

                to sys-rq, and provides a way to override the reboot/shutdown by
                device

                layers that require it.

                        The host-config module exposes the following interfaces:
                        get,

                        patch, and parse.


                        `get` gets host configuration such as redsocks proxy
                        configuration

                        and hostname and returns it in an object of type
                        HostConfiguration.


                        `patch` takes an object of type HostConfiguration or
                        LegacyHostConfiguration

                        and updates the hostname and redsocks proxy
                        configuration, optionally

                        forcing the patch through update locks.


                        `parse` takes a user input of unknown type and parses it
                        into type

                        HostConfiguration or LegacyHostConfiguration for
                        patching, erroring if

                        parse was unsuccessful.


                        LegacyHostConfiguration is a looser typing of the user
                        input which does

                        not validate values of the five known proxy fields of
                        type, ip, port,

                        username, and password. We should stop supporting it in
                        the next

                        major Supervisor API release.

                        This fixes a regression on the supervisor state engine
                        computation

                        (added on v16.2.0) when

                        the target state removes a network at the same time that
                        a service

                        referencing that network is changed. Example going from


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: 3.18
                              networks: ['balena']

                        networks:
                           balena:
                        ```


                        to


                        ```

                        services:
                           one:
                              image: alpine: latest
                        ```


                        Would never reach the target state as killing the
                        service in order to

                        remove the network is prioritized, but one of the
                        invariants in the target state calculation is

                        to not kill any services until all images have been
                        downloaded. These

                        two instructions were in contradiction leading to a
                        deadlock.


                        The fix involves only adding removal steps for services
                        depending on a

                        changing network or volume if the service container is
                        not being removed

                        already.

                At this moment the kexec initrd script is skipped when
                ROOTFS_DIR

                is not defined or if the new rootfs is mounted, but does not
                contain

                a kernel image in the expected place. This is undesirable as we

                assume this is the last script executed by the balena
                bootloader.


                This patch makes the kexec script always execute in the balena

                bootloader and makes it fail hard in unexpected states, which
                means

                the script is always an exit point for the balena bootloader,

                whether the actual kexec call succeeds or not.

                At this moment the kexec initrd script just takes the original
                kernel

                command line, replaces root with UUID and removes bootloader
                args.


                We have found at least one use-case (on the Pi4 and firmware
                GPIOs),

                where a different initrd script needs to pass extra arguments

                to the kexec'd kernel. With this patch it will append the
                contents

                of the KEXEC_EXTRA_ARGS variable to the kernel command line.

                In 328222014146f0116e0208443f3e255d0e85ef15 we have removed

                the signed-update hook from systems that do not have EFI

                in MACHINE_FEATURES. This on its own makes sense, however
                together

                with it we have also removed the runtime check for whether the
                running

                system is actually booted in UEFI mode.


                This effectively means it is no longer possible to update the
                host OS

                on a device type able to boot in both UEFI and BIOS modes

                (intel-nuc and genericx86-64-ext) when booted in BIOS mode,

                as the signed-update hook is executed unconditionally and fails

                if the device is not running UEFI.


                This patch re-adds the runtime check to only execute the hook

                if the system is actually booted in UEFI mode.

                        This goes in the direction of grouping modules by
                        responsibility. The

                        api-binder module is the middleware between the device
                        and the backend,

                        thus the target state polling code makes more sense
                        there.

                We have detected one more way in which the uuid file used by
                containerd

                can get corrupted. This time, the file is not empty, but doesn't
                contain

                a valid UUID either.


                This commit thus extends the existing workaround to also handle
                this

                case.

                When reading from efi variables in hostapp-update hooks during
                rollback,

                tcgtool will improperly read zero bytes from efivar files. This
                results

                in an improper calculation of the PCR 7 digest, and an
                unbootable

                system.


                Read the file contents, skipping the first four bytes that are

                attributes, and pipe the data directly to tcgtool to work around
                this.

                Some hooks, such as 0-signed-update, will attempt to read files
                from the

                EFI system partition, such as combined policy binaries.


                Bind mount the EFI partition into old_rootfs before running
                hooks to

                ensure this is available.

                When rollback-health runs, a failing healthcheck causes the

                hostapp-update hooks to be run from the inactive partition, to
                make the

                inactive system bootable again.


                The 0-signed-update hook, which updates the sealing policy for
                secure

                boot enabled systems, reads from the securityfs mounted at

                /sys/kernel/security in order to parse the TPM event log.


                If this filesystem isn't mounted, the hook will improperly
                detect that

                the TPM event log isn't available, and unneccessarily create a
                combined

                policy when a single PCR policy would suffice.


                Mount this filesystem in old_rootfs before chrooting to fix
                this.

                In commit 1c19ebb, we append digests from the TPM event log

                corresponding to events that are logged before EV_SEPARATOR. For

                instance, parsing the event log on a typical system for event
                types, the

                output looks like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This system requires no merging of event log digests.


                On systems that measure EFI binaries (mostly only QEMU w/ edk2),
                we also

                get this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bootx64.efi)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY (bzImage)


                Again, this requires no merging. We compute the signature of the

                relevant EFI binaries ourselves, as they're subject to change
                during

                hostapp-update.


                However, we've also seen event logs like this:


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_EFI_ACTION (DMA Protection Disabled)

                EV_SEPARATOR


                This case is the one we've handled previously, by reading from
                the event

                log and appending event digests before EV_SEPARATOR. We stopped
                at

                EV_SEPARATOR because we weren't parsing event types previously,
                and this

                digest is a constant that's easily recognized. However, we've
                since

                encountered systems that have unexpected events *after*
                EV_SEPARATOR, as

                shown below.


                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (SecureBoot)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (PK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (KEK)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (db)

                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_DRIVER_CONFIG (dbx)

                EV_SEPARATOR

                Unknown event type (?!)


                In order to handle this, parse digests and event types into
                temporary

                files and iterate through them together. We only stop appending
                digests

                from the event log when the next event type is
                EV_EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHORITY

                (EFI binary signature) or we hit the end of the list. This
                should

                account for all possible variations.

                Manipulating the firewall rules by index introduces a race
                condition.

                Both NetworkManager and balenaEngine add the rules to the top

                of the FORWARD chain instead of appending, so if we first look
                up

                a rule by number and then use the number to refer to it, we can
                not

                guarantee that the rule number has not changed (iow the rule has
                not

                been moved down) in the meantime.


                This patch removes the use of rule numbers completely and makes

                the "shared" dispatcher script refer to the rules by definition.

                This is a fix targeted for the revpi-connect-4 which requires a

                we did this test results in the config.txt being wiped - so now

                        of decoding unknown objects. In <2.2.21, a record with a
                        custom key type

                        will decode an unknown object to Left if it has a key is
                        not of the custom

                        type. Whereas in io-ts@2.2.21, t.record will strip the
                        invalid key and

                        decode to Right. This is a breaking change for us.

                        The Supervisor should only care whether a lockfile
                        exists or

                        not. This also fixes an edge case where a user symlinked
                        a lockfile

                        to a nonexistent file, causing the Supervisor to enter
                        an error

                        loop as it was not able to `stat` the nonexistent file.

                        io-ts types that were generated using

                        against `VAR_NAME_REGEX`, instead of the Regex that was
                        specified when

                        generating the type. This affected `DockerName` such
                        that service names with

                        a dash in the middle were returning as false when passed

                This commit introduces a command line argument override for

                integration layers to use. This allows for example for

                As soon as the UUID is regenerated udev runs the correspondign
                rules.


                However, the rules expect the new UUID to be cached in a file,
                so there

                is a race condition between the creation of the file and the
                udev rule.


                This commit avoid the race condition by using a file mutex that
                the

                udev rule can wait on.

                Remounting filesystems is done on systems with a broken clock in
                order

                to prevent tune2fs from bailing out when the last mounted time
                is in the

                future. This resets the last mounted time to now.


                However, the filesystem is immediately unmounted again without
                being

                utilized, and the mount and unmount process is time consuming.
                Instead,

                use `-e continue` to tell tune2fs to continue after an error,
                which

                achieves the same result with less time and complexity.

                Incidentally, the previous code also had a small bug/typo, in
                which we

                mixed a test for string length with a test for string equality.

                The include syntax allows full control over settings used

                in each test job, but the combinatorial is simpler to write

                for basic use cases.


                Rather than force one, we can allow both and default to the
                simple

                syntax.


                Marking as minor since the input syntax has changed, but isn't

                currently used in production anywhere.

                When a ESR release is deployed a tag with the base meta-balena
                version

                is created. This is used by the API to check for a valid OS
                version

                for updates.


                The current mechanism to find the base version only provides an
                ESR

                version for the first commit after the branch has been created.


                Using merge-base to find the common ancestor and `tag
                --points-at` to

                find the actual tag works for all commits after the branch is
                created.

                Git describe does not include commit tags by default, and only
                annotated tags are shown.


                This behaviour was fine until a recent CI issue changed the
                types of tags used to version the repositories.


                This commit allows supporting of both types while the CI issue
                is investigated.

                For some device types it's been noted that it takes longer than
                the time it takes do do one check of the iptables rules for the
                intended rules to appear, leading to a failure. This aims to
                make the check more consistent by checking 5 times before
                failing.

                Older balenaOS version (before v2.58) do not contain the logging
                helper

                in the rootfs and the new OS hooks fail to execute.


                This commit checks for the file existence before using it, and
                defines

                the logging functions when not detected.

                This change is required to migrate existing tests to run QEMU
                worker tests on GitHub Actions.

                GitHub hosted runners can't run the `ping` command:
                https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/1519 by design.

                If we still intend to use `ping`, the solution would be running
                QEMU worker tests on self-hosted runners which allow ICMP
                packets

                The takeover project currently relies on the ldd script being
                present in the hostOS pre-migration.


                While takeover can be adapted to use this script from a
                different location, it wouldn't hurt to have ldd in the hostOS
                from this point on.

                The main variables measured into PCR7 to ensure secure boot
                configuration integrity are the state and EFI vars, including PK, KEK,
                db, dbx, etc.

                However, some systems have firmware that will measure other, unexpected
                events, such as "DMA Protection Disabled" (related to a Windows feature
                [0]), or "Unknown event type" with strange data.

                These events can't be predicted, and other devices may have different
                measured events that aren't compliant with the TCG spec, so attempt to
                check the TPM event log and extend our digest with any unknown events
                that fit the bill.

                When migrating the TPM2 policy used to secure the LUKS
                passphrase to use

                different PCRs, we temporarily want to maintain fallback
                capability in

                case the newly installed hostapp doesn't pass healthchecks. This
                allows

                the system to boot back into the original OS and try again.


                In order to do so, we leave the passphrase in place with the old
                PCR

                authentication policy. The cryptsetup hook in the initramfs will
                try

                PCRs 0,2,3,7 and if those don't work we fallback to the original
                PCRs.


                Once the new system successfully boots, we'll re-encrypt the
                passphrase

                and use the new PCRs to create a policy to secure the key.

                When encrypting the LUKS passphrase, we need the ability to
                construct a

                policy that can logically OR together multiple policies, such as
                when

                the machine may or may not measure binaries loaded through EFI
                boot

                services into PCR7.


                We also need the ability to update the sealing policy to revoke

                previously valid configurations, such as after
                hostapp-healthcheck

                completes successfully. Ideally, this should be completed before

                modifying any efi variables, to prevent the system from becoming

                unbootable in the event of an interrupted update.


                These requirements necessitate the ability to create sealing
                policies

                and authenticate against them outside of the
                hw_{en,de}crypt_passphrase

                functions.


                This commit allows the caller to setup the sealing policy when

                encrypting, and choose what kind of authentication to use when

                decrypting.

                to represent data measured and hashed to extend TPM PCRs.


                This is useful to compute a PCR hash at runtime, which is

                computed by the firmware before the OS boots. This allows for
                adjusting

                a TPM2 policy to unlock the disk encryption passphrase with the
                updated

                state on the next boot.

                Yocto already splits the build sstate by target arch, native
                arch, toolchains, and machine where applicable.


                Keeping the caches separated by device type prevents sharing of
                common cache steps between identical toolchains and
                architectures.

              hash: 374c4c32df59cc00e0b04d0c619f6fb98a69f1a5
              body: >
                The dispatcher script that moves around FORWARD rules of shared

                interfaces currently calls iptables assuming it will always work

                but in practice two iptables commands can not run in parallel

                and we have occasionally seen the script fail with:


                Another app is currently holding the xtables lock.

                Perhaps you want to use the -w option?


                This patch adds the -w option to make the script wait for the
                lock

                when necessary.


                It also makes the script exit with an error code if anything
                fails,

                which will log the output as WARN instead of INFO as the errors

                are easy to overlook at this moment.

                We don't need any iptables features in order to perform

                hostapp-update in this build recipe, and it has no impact

                on build output.


                It does, however, improve compatbility with build environments
                and

                reduces the dependencies of the build host kernel.

                The supervisor will now write the following dtoverlay setting

                "gpio-key,gpio=4,active_low=0,gpio_pull=down"

                into config.txt in the following form:

                dtoverlay=gpio-key
                dtparam=gpio=4
                dtparam=active_low=0
                dtparam=gpio_pull=down

                So we need to rework the test to account for these changes.

                a203bcdfd567c0cc4b4ed9de493513142cd7463f introduced a dependency

                on /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults to hostapp-update-hooks,
                however

                during HUP the script is not only executed in the "new" OS
                container

                but directly in the context of the "old" OS as well, so

                /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults needs to exist there.

                The file was introduced in balenaOS v2.99.28, so trying to HUP

                from anything before that will fail.


                This patch changes this to a soft dependency so even if the file

                is missing HUP will continue.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe looks for the root
                partition

                by UUID and assumes that only a single device is returned. This

                assumption breaks when the root is on a MD RAID1 device as not
                only

                the virtual MD device holds a filesystem with the given UUID,

                each member does as well.


                This patch makes resin_update_state_probe ignore devices

                that are RAID members which in that case will only return

                the MD device as expected.

                Currently devices with on-board storage fail to build in jenkins, if they don't provide a flasher image. One example is the CM4. Since there are multiple devices using this configuration, let's re-enable builds for all of them.

                        RPI firmware configuration allows repeating overlays to
                        define

                        configurations on multiple devices. For instance, for
                        configuring

                        multiple `ads` devices, `config.txt` needs to be setup
                        this way


                        ```

                        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x48

                        ```


                        Before this change, the supervisor would interpret both

                        repeated overlays coming from the cloud side.

                        Rsync (v2) deltas have been broken since [Supervisor v14](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/commit/460c3ba0aab31d18a02e3f5dda1838691768c494). While considered legacy,
                        they are still used by a few customers with devices running OS < 2.47.1.
                        This should fix v2 delta support for those devices until we can
                        completely remove rsync deltas from the supervisor

                      hash: e22253ce6ebc40e865b5bc26844901026f04ec4e
                      body: >
                        Previously, getBootConfig() of the config.txt backend
                        was omitting

                        array configurations such as gpio settings, thus
                        resulting in the SV

                        mistakenly assuming that boot config had not been
                        applied, since gpio

                        would not be in current config.txt config but would be
                        in target config.

                        This resulted in SV entering an infinite loop of
                        attempting to apply the

                        gpio config when it wasn't necessary.

                      hash: 6e6a796da5ecc846248eae4c8495bc626964c038

                        While ordering is important in the RPI firmware configuration file (config.txt),
                        some dt params are by default considered part of the base dt overlay
                        if they are not used by other overlays.
                        Unfortunately the [list of dtparams](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L133)
                        is too long to add all of them as exceptions, but we can add the params
                        used in the default config.txt provided in OS images, to avoid reboots
                        when updating to this new supervisor and correctly parsing the
                        provisioning config.txt as variables.

                        While this addition handles most common scenarios, there is still a
                        chance a user may have use other base overlay dt params in the initial
                        config, in which case those will be interpreted according to the
                        relative ordering

                        DT overlays and DT params need to be consumed in the
                        order that they

                        appear on the file. DT params apply to the last
                        dtoverlay defined on the

                        file, or to the base overlay.


                        This commit updates config.txt parsing to consider this
                        ordering, and it

                        also ensures global dtparams are written first so they
                        cannot be

                        overriden by later overlays.


                        Because of the more strict parsing method, it is
                        possible that existing

                        HOST_CONFIG vars do not match the interpretation of the
                        parser. If

                        that's the case, the supervisor will re-apply the target
                        state which

                        will cause the device to reboot.

                During HUP, rollback-health-breadcrumb and
                rollback-altboot-breadcrumb

                are created in the state partition to trigger rollback-health
                and

                rollback-altboot respectively on the next boot. After these
                services

                complete, they will remove these breadcrumbs.


                Make the broken init fallback tests wait for these services to
                become

                inactive before testing the state of the breadcrumbs. Otherwise,
                a race

                condition can make these tests fail. Most notably on slower
                systems,

                such as emulated generic-aarch64.

                Without this dependency, the call to `jq` does not happen and
                the check

                for INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL is not performed.


                Several devices that define internal storage but do not define

                INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL will now fail and need to be fixed.

              hash: 4b1bc7244ab21a9952ea7569c0c0e1bc9a11e2e0
              body: >
                The balena bootloader initramfs contains the rootfs module and
                that

                will get the rootfs mounted but not checked first for errors.
                This is

                problematic because at first boot with network connectivity
                available,

                time will sync but the rootfs will still have the last mount
                time in

                1970. If at that point the rootfs gets corrupted then at next
                boot

                the rootfs' initramfs module from balena-bootloader will try to
                mount

                the rootfs without checking it first and then after that the
                filesystem

                check triggered by the fsck module from the actual kernel
                initramfs will

                fail like this:


                [init][INFO] Running filesystem checks on partition resin-rootA
                (/dev/disk/by-state/resin-rootA)

                resin-rootA contains a file system with errors, check forced.

                resin-rootA: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked
                list found.


                resin-rootA: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
                        (i.e., without -a or -p options)

                This commit will add the fsck module to balena bootloader's
                initramfs

                which will trigger filesystem checks before the rootfs module
                runs.

                This fixes rollback-health failures for boards like the Jetson
                Seeeed

                J4012, which updates efivars for capsule updates from container
                hooks

                and not from the current OS hooks.


                While the actual HUP works because of /sys being bindmounted by

                hostapp-update, rollbacks will fail to run the old OS hooks
                unless

                efivarfs is mounted.

                        Moby v25 adds the dynamically generated MAC address to
                        the Config field,

                        which breaks the state engine, preventing the state from
                        settling as the

                        current state never matches the target state (empty mac
                        address). This

                        seems to be a bug in Moby that we reported in
                        moby/moby#47228


                        The issue won't affect Balena devices until balenaEngine
                        is updated, and this

                        change fixes testing for now.

                        prettierrc will allow formatting to work correctly with
                        editor plugins


                        This also updates editorconfig to work well with json

                The class will perform a basic configuration of a linux kernel

                to be used as the balena bootloader. Device types are expected

                to inherit it and perform additional device-specific
                configuration.

                The kexec initrd script currently removes the maxcpus=0 kernel
                arg

                which we use to put the system into non-SMP mode. This however
                does

                not work on all platforms and nr_cpus=1 seems to be a more
                robust

                solution, so with this patch nr_cpus will be removed as well.

                chain"
              hash: 089f4d639383a4981d4840f9e22cccc97270b339
              body: >
                At this moment there is a race condition between NetworkManager

                and the engine when a shared interface is configured. If the
                interface

                is configured first and the engine second, the containers are
                allowed

                to access DHCP hosts behind the shared interface. If the engine
                comes

                up first and the shared interface second, access will be denied.


                This patch adds a dispatcher script that always configures the
                firewall

                rules as if the engine came up last. This does not really
                address

                the underlying issue but it overcomes the race condition and
                makes

                the behavior deterministic, which is good enough at this point.

                We've noticed that leaving the host discoverable indefinitely on
                Pi3 Autokit hosts solves sporadic scan failures. Thus, leaving
                the host discoverable for 20 minutes should be sufficient to
                prevent these cases.

                        resolve `.local` queries via dnsmasq by modifying

                        The `updateMetadata` step renames the container to match
                        the target

                        release when the service doesn't change between
                        releases. We have seen

                        this step fail because of an engine bug that seems to
                        relate to the

                        engine keeping stale references after container
                        restarts. The only way

                        around this issue is to remove the old container and
                        create it again.

                        This implements that workaround during the
                        updateMetadata step to deal

                        with that issue.

                There have been reports of an empty config vars cache file -
                probably

                because of a race condition when the reading of config.json
                happens just

                as the file is being replaced.


                Add some checks and retries to avoid this errors from happening.

              hash: 0f3bd475dadc52aa48f7b98bf18e4cd3a1b9e9e7

                The log files are kept in the /run partition that also houses
                the udev database.

                By moving the /run partition to $ROOTFS_DIR/run in the migrate
                module, the udev database persists across reboots.

                The udevcleanup module was introduced to cleanup the database
                so it's regenerated on the final rootfs as the rules are
                different between initramfs and final rootfs. By moving /run
                before udevcleanup ran, the cleanup was not effective.

                This commit moves the relocation of the /run mount to the
                finish module, after udevcleanup is run, and groups it with
                the other relocations needed for the pivot switch.

                Looking at git history, the relocation of the /run partition
                was initially done in the rootfs module, so when the migrate
                module was introduced and needed to mount the rootfs, this
                relocation was just moved into the migration module itself,
                without considering later modules like finish.

                This provides an easy switch to enable tracing on HUP hooks that
                works

                both on old and new OS hooks as enabling it depends on a
                config.json

                setting.


                It is meant to debug field issues with HUP failure where all we
                see is:

                ```

                Before hooks (old os) ran successfully

                Failed to run the new hooks. Running current hooks..

                ```

                For example:

                Detecting whether the script is running in a PID namespace by
                checking

                `/proc/1/sched` does not work for newer kernels

                (see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17917).


                Properly detecting this is too cumbersome for a bash logging
                script,

                see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17902, however,
                falling

                back to the last check, that is, seeing if `/.dockerenv` exists
                is easy

                enough and works for our use case.


                This script will only be called from the hostOS, and the only
                case it is

                called from a container is during HUP and the container is
                always a hostOS

                image. So even though the interface chosen by moby, a file under
                /,

                is a bad interface in general, it works fine for the specific
                limitations

                of balenaOS.


                Also, check for `/run/.containerenv` which is the equivalent
                interface

                for podman for future proofing.

                        Whenever the Supervisor reports current state, it diffs
                        the current state

                        with its last reported current state. However, when the
                        Supervisor starts

                        up, there is no last reported state, since that last
                        report is stored in

                        process memory. Caching the last report in a location
                        that survives

                        Supervisor restarts will reduce the current report
                        bandwidth used on startup.

                We add a script which can be replaced by device repositories
                to implement device-specific healthchecks. One usecase for this
                test is the Jetson UEFI firmware update check,
                but can be extended to all other devices as needed.

                We previously tried to use a single time limit for the execution
                of the

                healthcheck test on all device types. This was causing
                occasional false

                positives in our Continuous Integration pipeline, though --
                especially

                on slow devices like Pi Zeros and the generic-aarch64, which
                runs on

                emulated hardware.


                This commit addresses this issue, this commit:


                1. Limits execution for device types for which we have collected
                enough
                   data to have a good idea of how long the test should take.
                2. Uses time limits specific for each device type.

                        PR #2217 removed the expose configuration but also
                        caused a regresion

                        where ports set via the `ports` configuration would no
                        longer get

                        exposed to the host, despite portmappings being set.
                        This fixes that

                        issue by exposing only those ports comming from port
                        mappings.

                        the port. In newer engine implementations, this property
                        may conflict

                        with other network configurations, and prevent the
                        container from being

                        started by the docker engine (see #2211).


                        This PR removes code that would manage the expose
                        property and takes the

                        property out of the whitelist. A composition with the
                        `expose` property

                        will result in the log message `Ignoring unsupported or
                        unknown compose fields: expose`.


                        While this change should not have operational impact, it
                        still removes

                        a previously supported configuration and as such there
                        is a chance of it

                        being a breaking change for some applications. For this
                        reason it is

                        being published as a new major version.

                The code moved from meta-balena-kirkstone was not really
                specific to

                kirkstone so let's move it here so that future branches for
                newer yocto

                releases which we'll base off kirkstone don't continue to add
                this

                unneeded  duplication.

                There are other meta-balena-* directories that still contain the

                duplication we moved from meta-balena-kirkstone but we're not
                really

                concerned with that because going forward those old directories
                will

                naturally get deprecated.

                If the target supervisor image is already cached but there is no

                container running with it, the update script would just exit
                without

                actually running the target supervisor.


                This commit checks whether there is a running container using
                the

                target image and restarts the supervisor if there is none.

                rebooted. We

                don't want to mislead users with only full-disk encryption into
                thinking

                their system also has secure boot enabled when it doesn't.


                Disable the hook to unlock encrypted partitions if the firmware
                fails to

                boot into user mode.

                This flag isn't needed on balenaOS as the splash screen
                remains even after plymouthd is stopped.

                Having the flag in place prevents user apps from writing to
                tty consoles after stopping plymouth via dbus.

                        0c7bad779291e15e419166a2c66c2a21dd06aa83, as that

                        change causes a service restart loop. The supervisor
                        cannot distinguish

                        between ports exposed via the `EXPOSE` directive and the
                        docker-compose

                        `expose` property. Because of this, in the case of
                        `network-mode:

                        service:<...>` the current state and target state never
                        match, leading

                        to a service restart loop.

                        The supervisor exposes ports configured using the
                        `EXPOSE` directive in

                        the dockerfile when configuring the container for
                        runtime. This can

                        cause issues if using `network_mode: service:<service
                        name>` as the

                        expose configuration is not compatible with that network
                        mode. This

                        fix now skips image exposed ports for that particular
                        network mode.

                When searching for devices matching the glob list in

                get_internal_device(), a glob match breaks from a nested loop
                rather

                than the parent loop, allowing the function to output multiple
                matches.


                When running the flasher, this results in the script failing
                with an

                incorrect path to the internal disk.


                Break from the parent loop to fix this behavior.

                        Alpine allows the `~=` syntax to match a part of the
                        package version

                        when installing. In this case we want to use it to
                        specify node and

                        npm major versions

                This is done by the bootloader (uboot/grub) at this moment but
                as we

                are moving towards the balena 2nd stage bootloader, it needs to
                be

                moved into the initramfs.


                This adds a standalone recipe - by default yocto tries to build
                all

                modules defined in the initramfs-framework recipe, which breaks

                on armv7 when abroot is defined there. This is because it
                depends

                on grub-editenv which is not supported on armv7.

                The rootfs script uses both os-helpers-fs and os-helpers-logging

                though the package depends on neither. This seems to work now
                because

                in most cases something else pulls in the dependencies or the
                code

                on a particular device does not fall under the branches that use

                the missing functions.

                        This commit updates balena-containerd to a new version
                        in which we

                        cherry-picked the change from here:
                        https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/8086


                        This change avoids enabling AppArmor if the
                        `/sbin/apparmor_parser`

                        binary is not found in the system.

              body: >
                314047e and b5c5214 made flasher block until the
                resin-device-register

                service exits and made resin-device-register give up after 6
                seconds

                not to block infinitely when no network is available. This
                effectively

                means that if the device fails to register within first 6
                seconds,

                it will never retry, flasher will not report status to the
                dashboard

                and the device will only register on first boot.


                This patch changes the logic back to resin-device-register
                trying

                in the background in an infinite loop and moves the "give the
                device

                a chance to register" delay to flasher itself. It also extends

                the wait to openvpn as flasher already does that and wants VPN
                to run

                to be debuggable - in case flashing fails, it would be possible

                to SSH in via the VPN and look at the logs remotely.

                The kernel-balena class contains:

                CONIFG_SECURITY=n


                which is mispelled and not being applied. The commit where this
                was

                introduced claims it's needed to completely disable the audit
                logs, and

                also that the security framework is unused.


                I disagree in that it's unused - the hostOS is not using any
                security

                framework, but applications may, so luckily the security
                framework was

                never disabled.


                Removing this mispelled entry should have no functional effect.
                Whether

                the audit subsystem is disabled will depend on the final kernel

                configuration. Definitely we have not seen a need to disable it
                recently,

                and we have not seen the kernel log flooded with messages.


                I'd argue the disabling of the audit subsystem in meta-balena
                serves no

                need but I also have no specific reason to remove it at the
                moment.

                At this moment grub.cfg sources /grub/grub_extraenv which works
                fine

                on MBR systems, however on EFI systems this does not work
                because GRUB

                is installed in /EFI/BOOT/ rather than /grub/.


                This patch replaces the hardcoded /grub with ${prefix} which
                should

                expand to the appropriate directory regardless of the platform.
                It also

                removes the loading of grub_extraenv from the secure boot
                variant

                of the GRUB config since this would not load without a signature
                anyway.

                The SIM7600G modem will fail to connect using
                QMI and the default 45s timeout, nor will it work
                with a 65s one. The value we found to work consistently
                with this modem connected over pcie is 95s.

      hash: fe2786b65be31c3c6c863cc1c21b3a745c79eb8f
      body: >
        On a dfferent type of CDS devices, the state symlink to the mts-bootpack

        partition may be present when hup starts but later when

        dd is used to calculate the md5sum they were removed


        It's possible that udev repopulates the /dev/disk/by- directories,

        so let's check if the initial symlink disappeared and

        perform a couple retries if it did, to see if it gets re-created or

        can be obtained from the partlabel directory.

        At most, if none of the symlinks exist anymore the update will fail and
        the

        hooks from the previous OS will run. The update procedure should

        be re-triggered from the API in this case.

                GitHub App installation tokens are short-lived and do not
                need to be rotated the same way PATs do.

                cryptsetup lazily depends on libgcc. With libgcc missing,
                certain

                operations, especially luksOpen will fail with

                `libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_exit to work`

                which panics the kernel and triggers a reboot loop
                indistinguishable

                from a "device has been tampered with" state on regular builds

                with no console output.

                systems with secure boot and full-disk encryption.

                process in the first stage kernel, so bail out on failure.

                The 6.1 kernel has a number of Kbuild and architecture changes
                that required us to update our devsrc recipe. With these changes
                we are once again able to build on target modules for all
                supported archectures.

                        It's not an official status from container inspects, and
                        the Supervisor

                        doesn't set it internally anywhere. It's better to
                        remove it entirely as the

                        method by which Supervisor sets internal service
                        statuses is by using a global

                        event emitter (reportNewStatus) which makes things
                        difficult to test.

                We have seen devices that won't change PCR1 hash when a
                temporary boot

                order override was applied or secure boot was disabled via BIOS
                setup.

                The implementation of what PCR1 actually measures is very

                device-specific, but many of the risks can be mitigated by
                setting up

                a BIOS password and disabling F-key shortcuts for interacting
                with

                the firmware.

                To avoid using unstable outputs as API, use image tags instead.

              body: >
                Both `kernel-modules-headers` and `kernel-devsrc` provide kernel
                headers

                since Yocto Thud switched `kernel-devsrc` from full source to
                just

                kernel headers.


                The only difference between them is that
                `kernel-modules-headers` builds

                some target binaries which need to be built with `make
                modules_prepare`

                when using `kernel-devsrc` headers. These binaries depend on
                libc version

                matching though so they have shown to be problematic.


                This commit removes the `kernel-modules-headers` recipe and
                modifies

                `kernel-devsrc` to replace it. The deployed artifact remains
                named as

                `kernel-modules-headers` as it's a more descriptive name.


                This introduces a breaking change in the balenaOS API as
                customers that

                are using `kernel-modules-headers` to build external kernel
                modules will

                now need to issue a `make modules_prepare` as part of their
                build scripts.


                Fixes #1822

                After switching to LUKS2, the header size increased from 2MB to
                16MB.

                While HUP of older systems works, it is impossible to provision

                new encrypted systems.


                This patch fixes the header size in flasher.

                      body: >
                        The previous implementation in #2170 of parsing the
                        container status was too general,

                        because it relied on the mistaken assumption that a
                        container would have a status of

                        `Stopped` if it was manually stopped. This turned out to
                        be untrue, as manually stopped

                        containers were also getting restarted by the Supervisor
                        due to their inspect status of

                        `exited`. With this, parsing the exit message became
                        unavoidable as there are no other

                        clear ways to discern a container that has been manually
                        stopped and shouldn't be started

                        from a container experiencing the Engine-host race
                        condition issue (again, see #2170).


                        Since we're just parsing the exit error message, we
                        don't need to worry about different behaviors

                        amongst restart policies, as any container with the
                        error message on exit should be started.

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the
                        second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that
                        concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()`
                        used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`.
                        So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all
                        the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail
                        before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not
                        in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed,
                        running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test
                        cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before.
                        For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers
                        of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image.
                        In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a
                        buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the
                        second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an
                        `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would
                        prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the
                        basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those
                        blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL,
                        instead of

                        That 21kB LITERAL is the difference in size we saw in
                        the test results.

                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                end up with LUKS1 partitions. This patch adds the parameter to
                enforce

                LUKS2 formatting and adds conversion to LUKS2 to the cryptsetup

                initrd script.

                This helper command saves and compares crc32 sum for a memory
                area where the kernel image or the device-tree is loaded.

                Can be used after loading the kernel and the dtb, and also prior
                to calling booti.

                When building signed images, add the secureBoot feature flag
                into the

                OS contract. This is needed for other components to identify
                secureBoot

                compatible software releases.

                When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake
                build,

                keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However,
                the

                splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence,
                which

                results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is

                problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with
                equals

                signs.


                Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

                        restart policy
                      hash: 7f3214195838a8bf3242ef7540b4487338687e4c
                      body: >
                        There exists a race condition between Engine and a host
                        resource that may not

                        be immediately created. In this race condition, if a
                        container's compose config

                        depends on the existence of that host resource, such as
                        a network interface, and the

                        Engine tries to create & start the container before the
                        host resource is created, the

                        Engine will not reattempt to start the container,
                        regardless of the restart policy.

                        This is undesireable behavior but seems to be the
                        behavior as implemented by Docker.


                        To rectify this, the Supervisor state funnel noops for a
                        grace period of 1 minute

                        after starting a container to see that the container's
                        status has become 'running`.

                        If the container exits because of the race condition,
                        the status becomes 'exited' and the

                        Supervisor will attempt to generate another start step.
                        This noop-wait-start step loop

                        will repeat until the container is able to start.


                        If the container is never able to start, there was a
                        problem in the host in the creation of the

                        host resource, and that should be fixed at the host
                        level.


                        This commit does not handle the case of services with
                        restart policies "no" or "on-failure"

                        which encounter this host race, as metadata from
                        container inspects needs to be introduced

                        during step calculation in order to figure out whether
                        services with those restart policies

                        need to be started. This will be fixed in a future PR.

                This commit adds a check for the script to exists instead of
                getting a

                `command not found` when an API endpoint is defined.

                The purpose of testing the API calls is to detect breaking
                changes, not

                to fail builds because of temporary network or API access
                problems.


                Printing a warning instead should be enough for developers to
                detect

                breaking changes.

                        Support for colon characters was added v14.6.0 which
                        enabled

                        configurations for HDMI port 2 (e.g on the RPi 4). These
                        configurations

                        are not documented anywhere else so this allows users to
                        be able to

                        better find the relevant information for working with

                When programming keys for secure boot, some devices do not clear

                the setup mode flag after a new PK is installed. In this case

                flasher will reboot in order to ensure the keys are actually
                saved

                and the device comes back with secure boot enabled. Since we
                changed

                flasher to be unsigned by default, this reboot causes a security

                violation.


                With this patch flasher will add a new boot entry before issuing

                the reboot so that signed flasher comes up and the installation
                process

                can continue.

                Currently the db.auth file is signed as "append" in order to
                make HUP work.

                Most UEFI firmwares will accept such file even for "replace",
                which we do

                during the initial provisioning, however we have seen devices
                that will

                only allow appending, which makes flasher fail.


                With this patch flasher will use the esl file for initial
                programming

                of the db variable.


                PK and KEK are unaffected.

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked
                        fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a
                        particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to
                        finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll
                        keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the
                        interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages
                        about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                        the flasher image to force an installer migration.


                        With the current QEMU setting, `installerForceMigration`
                        alone is not

                        enough and the QEMU_INTERNAL_STORAGE also needs to be
                        set to false in

                        the worker's environment so only a single external disk
                        is attached to

                        the emulator.

      hash: 65878cf834b91fe106f1c63bd1b6ff86c9e54b04
      body: >
        Backporting to ESR branches hits a flowzone error as both pull_request

        and pull_request_target run and this only works for master.


        Removing the pull_request_target run for ESR branches fixes this, but

        also removes the possibility of external pull requests into ESR
        branches,

        which we don't actually need.

                        After a recent change enforcing all the partitions to be
                        on the same

                        block device, encrypted partitions are no longer being
                        detected

                        correctly. This is because the assumption that the
                        parent block device

                        is a substring of the actually mounted block device does
                        not work

                        for LUKS devices - the mount will either be
                        /dev/mapper/luks-XXX

                        or /dev/dm-X while the parent device is still e.g.
                        /dev/sda.


                        The usual balenaOS boot partition is also split in two -
                        boot and efi.

                        The boot partition (mounted under /mnt/boot) is
                        encrypted and the efi

                        partition (mounted under /mnt/efi) is not.


                        This patch generalizes the detection of the parent
                        device so that

                        it works with both encrypted and unencrypted partitions.

                        the `balena-supervisor` service for tests.


                        For this reason we now create a separate service to run
                        the built

                        supervisor `balena-supervisor-sut` and run API tests

                Both the migrator and secureboot tests assumed they were
                creating an

                installer config.json section. Modify the code so both settings
                are

                included.

                At this moment if the cryptsetup initrd script executes before
                the root

                device comes up (e.g. when booting off a USB disk), it assumes

                that encryption is not in place because it was not able to find

                the EFI partition.


                This patch adds a wait4file loop to the script that waits

                for the /dev/disk/by-state directory. This is not tied to any
                particular

                partition or device but since the directory does not exist by
                default

                and is only created by a custom balenaOS udev rule, its
                existence

                implies that the rule fired and a device with balenaOS
                partitions

                is present in the system.

                        A bug in service comparison would make it that a device
                        already running

                        a service from a new release with network changes would
                        never stop the

                        running service so remaining services would forever get
                        stuck in

                        `Downloaded` state.


                        This fixes the comparison so the service will get killed
                        in this case,

                        particularly allowing devices to recover from #1576

                        services in the `Downloaded` state, because the state

                        Previous behavior would make it that an `updateMetadata`

                        precedence over a `kill` step when network changes are
                        present. This

                        would lead to an inconsistent state if an update
                        included a

                        network and a container change.

                A safe copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw
                also and that is

                not the case for boot files. Still, some file like `config.json`
                would

                benefit from a safe copy so we still try that first.

                This is useful when performing hostOS updates for example where

                        The actions now work by passing an intermediate state to
                        the state

                        engine.


                        - doPurge first removes the user app from the target
                        state and passes
                          that to the state engine for purging. Since intermediate state doesn't
                          remove images, this will have the effect of basically re-installing
                          the app.

                        - doRestart modifies the target state by first removing
                        only the
                          services from the current state but keeping volumes and networks. This
                          has the same effect as before where services were stopped one by one

                        operations while in local mode. In reality, all it's
                        needed while in

                        local mode is to skip image and volume deletion.


                        This commit simplifies application-manager and compose
                        app to be more

                        local mode agnostic and instead making the image
                        deletion and volume

                        deletion configurable via function arguments.


                        This also has the benefit to make the treatment of local
                        mode

                        applications more similar to cloud mode applications,
                        allowing for

                        API endpoints to function the same way both modes.

                After moving to hashes for authenticating the allowed OS list,
                we need

                to update the db variable on each HUP to make sure the new OS

                will be bootable. After confirming that the update went through,

                we need to update the dbx variable to make sure the old OS is

                no longer bootable.

              hash: c205b247c14cbdd132cb1bb335da2d17fa40caf5
              body: >
                This patch changes the validation of bootable images from
                certificate

                signatures to a list of allowed hashes of binaries. This only
                applies

                on db level, PK and KEK are still certificates.


                The motivation is that certificates expire and we need to be
                sure

                that even devices that have been lying on a shelf for several
                years

                or whose CMOS battery has died and reset date to 1970-01-01 are
                still

                bootable. Using hashes is more aligned with this use-case and
                also

                more similar to the approach that embedded SoCs use.

              hash: 1eb49acca051d7c34fa0e48bd673fc764320b2e9
              body: >
                Shipping a single image with signature checks enabled will
                enforce

                the signatures on non-secure-boot systems as well. GRUB does not
                have

                a simple method to check whether secure boot is enabled that
                could

                be embedded with the default built-in config.


                With this patch we build two separate images - one enforcing

                the signatures and the other one not, keeping the original
                behavior.

                HUP and flasher both can detect if secure boot is enabled so
                they

                put the correct image in place when installing/updating GRUB.

                        Node 15 [changed the way it treats unhandled promise rejections](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V15.md#throw-on-unhandled-rejections---33021) from a warning to a throw.
                        For this reason errors like a corrupt migration directory, that happens when trying to
                        roll back to a previous supervisor version were no longer showing a
                        message but dumping the full minimized code into the journal logs.

                        This PR adds a catchall on app.ts to log the exception and throw an exit
                        code of 1.

                      hash: 49ee1042a87ce0b101054e32b84afaa324a371de
                      body: >
                        As the Supervisor is a privileged container, it has
                        access to host /dev, and therefore has access

                        to boot, data, and state balenaOS partitions. This
                        commit sets up the framework for the following:


                        - Finds the /dev partition that corresponds to each
                        partition based on partition label

                        - Mounts the partitions into set mountpoints in the
                        device

                        - Removes reliance on env vars and mountpoints provided
                        by host's start-balena-supervisor script

                        - Simplifies host path querying by centralizing these
                        queries through methods in lib/host-utils.ts


                        This particular changes env vars for and mounts the boot
                        partition.


                        Since the Supervisor would no longer rely on container
                        `run` arguments provided by a host script,

                        this change moves Supervisor closer to being able to
                        start itself (Supervisor-as-an-app).

                        Notable improvements these new versions bring:


                        * Optimized code path for generating deltas with blocks
                        that are
                          power-of-two-sized.
                        * Avoid allocating unbounded amounts of memory when the
                        target differs
                          completely from the source.
                        * Several bugfixes in edge cases that shall not affect
                        balenaEngine.

            - subject: Don't create core dumps in containers by default
              hash: 1a78f2a1a27684bf244c881555b691d63a3247f6
              body: >
                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files
                on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user
                app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually
                setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:


                ```

                services:
                  my-service:
                    ulimits:
                      core: -1
                ```


                (Where -1 is used to mean "unlimited")

                Setting `Delegate=yes` ensures that systemd will not change anything on
                the cgroups created for running the containers.

                This setting is used upstream since this commit:

                      hash: 2c972dff108a153896116b07798bbc959c07ef01

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream.
                        Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so
                        that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing
                        this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch
                        by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a
                        separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that
                        encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer
                        interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting
                        code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining
                        duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that
                        almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this
                        is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As
                        a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh`
                        as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing
                        any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for
                        two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                        * Fix the actual check. We previously used `[ $abort ]
                        && exit 1` which
                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                The patch applied to systemd addressed this upstream moby issue:
                https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/27202

                This was fixed in containerd 1.0.2:
                https://github.com/containerd/console/pull/10/commits/c358734ec94e72903243bd1c9034874a1de09424

                This fix is present in balena engine since v17.13.5, which has been in
                use since commit 53ce147. Drop this patch from meta-balena-dunfell and
                later.

                        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a
                        device powering

                        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to
                        "reflash" a virtualized

                        device before continuing with testing, for instance
                        after tampering with

                        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify
                        secure boot checks.


                        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The
                        `--exit-code-from`

                        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so
                        this results

                        in the test run aborting prematurely.


                        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container
                        to always

                        restart the program without exiting the container.

                The QEMU leviathan-worker now simulates flashing from an
                external

                device, which tests both flasher images, as well as

                secure-boot/full-disk encryption setup.


                Disable the ad-hoc unwrapping in the OS suite setup.

                utilizing

                the QEMU worker's new ability to bind a disk image to an

                It should be safe to assume that boards now use newer u-boot
                versions

                that all have Kconfig support so we default to that. This allows
                for

                device repos not to specify it and use Kconfig support or if for
                some

                reason there are boards with old u-boot versions they can
                overwrite the

                UBOOT_KCONFIG_SUPPORT variable to 0.

                Because we use this patch with various u-boot versions it often
                happens that this patch

                does not apply so we then need to rework it in the device
                integration layer. Instead it

                would be better to have some code at configure time parsing the
                same file and inserting

                the balena env dynamically, so regardless of u-boot versions we
                use.

                the build script parses the major version from `npm --version`
                and only

                sets unsafe-perm on npm 8 and older.

        carrier boards are on L4T 32.7.2 - 19-Aug-22, they most
        likely work fine with L4T 32.7.3 too.

        According to github action syntax [1], there is no special character
        to denote a match on zero or more of the preceding character, so

        characters with a `*`.

                There is nothing in `balena-config-vars` itself that needs
                `fatrw`, so

                change it so scripts don't exit if it is not available. For
                example,

                `balena-config-vars` gets used in the initramfs but `fatrw` is
                not

                required (and it is quite heavy).

                to define if RAID support is required.

                These dependencies are already part of the corresponding
                packagegroups,

                so listing them here is redundant and wrong as it increases the

                the initramfs with no reason.

                - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

                - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

                - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
                  rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
                - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the
                Lite version
                  which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
                  same balenaOS image.
                  I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
                  one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
                  Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
                  or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

                balenaOS uboot exports specific environment variables

                in resinOS_uEnv.txt and does not have any use-cases of

                saving the entire uboot environment in any device specific

                partitions. This because it relies on the default environment
                being

                stored in the u-boot binary.


                Let's disable the saveenv command and avoid potential incorrect

                usage which may overwrite the partition table, resin-boot
                filesystem

                or other areas of the eMMC that may be pre-configured by the
                BSP.

                Block device nodes are sometimes created without attached media.
                These

                devices can neither be read from, nor written to. In this case,
                the

                flasher will attempt to install to the invalid disk and
                fail.  Detect

                this case and skip the disk to allow flashing to continue.

                        blanket handles all

                        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.


                        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception,
                        just throw it.

                        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

                The engine is currently versioned in such a way that upstream
                semver tags are added to branches before merging to master.

                We don't want to try and pin to those commits so only
                consider automated GitHub Releases.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network
                        names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get
                        duplicates, this

                        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a
                        container referencing a duplicate

                        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


                        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the
                        state engine,

                        this means that even if somehow a container could be
                        referencing a

                        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this
                        will remove the

                        container first.


                        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate
                        networks being

                        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the
                        system to

                        correct the inconsistency.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some
                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,
                        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries
                        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of
                        the ambiguity.

                        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes
                        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor
                        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it
                        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.

                        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if
                        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will
                        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

                However, we have seen instances where a bash script sourcing a

                os-helper scripts triggers POSIX behaviour, specifically glob
                parsing

                failures.

                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in
                `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If
                any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public
                key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system
                again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't
                enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result
                in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly
                opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption
                along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to
                install

                without secure boot.

                Extended globbing is not enabled by default, which makes the

                SETUPMODEVAR to

                skipping

                key enrollment when secure boot is enabled. Compare using an
                integer

                expression instead.

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the
                purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher
                with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure
                boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in
                firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot
                is

                enforced, and empty when secure boot is unsupported.


                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is
                empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        Not all platforms support secure boot, notably aarch64

                        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate

                        only used when secure boot is enabled.

                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label
                of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev
                path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name
                under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks
                name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the
                resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                The flasher image enrolls the secure boot keys before rebooting
                into

                secured user mode and creating the encrypted luks volumes on
                disk.


                If the image is not signed, the key enrollment will fail, and
                the

                flasher will enter a loop trying to enroll them and rebooting.


                Instead, skip the key enrollment if the image is not signed,
                resulting

                in a non secure-boot installation.

              body: >
                In v2.108.0 we did a major NetworkManager upgrade as we started
                using

                meson as a build system. The connectivity check feature was left

                disabled, which is a regression and it produces fake results.


                This commit enables it back.


                Fixes #2964.

              body: >
                iptables takes a file lock at /run/xtables.lock. By default, if

                the file is locked, iptables will fail with error. When that
                happens,

                the iptables rules won't be configured, and the shared mode

                (for which we use iptables) will not be setup properly.


                Instead, pass "--wait 2", to block.


                The included patch has to be removed once we upgrade to next

                NetworkManager version as it is already included upstream.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated
                before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq
                instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by
                restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: |
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and
                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at
                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.
                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See
                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322

                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:

                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to
                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations
                that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we
                are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena
                is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code
                that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code
                that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

              body: >
                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is
                fixed upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being
                used.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always
                compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some
                CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression
                ratio.

              body: >
                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to
                unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes
                user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system
                unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first
                place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS
                volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI
                partition).

                Not all the boards we support have the redsocks uid as 995 in
                their rootfs so let's

                fetch the actual redsocks uid from the DUT before running the
                proxy tests and

                update that in the docker-compose.yml. We do so because the
                REDSOCKS_UID value

                isn't substituted in the compose if the variable, even if it is
                passed trough

                the cli.

                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio
                compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in
                balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in
                kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option,
                but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD
                is also

                missing.

                Generate a bmap file from the sparse image to allow for punching
                holes

                in the disk image ranges that were unmapped after building. This
                data is

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                writing, and verifying the sparse image.

                        Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds interval,
                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will
                        timeout too in 15 seconds:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162

                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to
                communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys,
                using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear
                down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth
                test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to
                authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on
                testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                There are two sets of keys used in this test, one stored in
                `/root/id`

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server,
                and

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the
                subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct
                private key.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching
                openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not
                get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.


                Fixes #2855

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root
                user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to
                break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the
                pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy
                step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the
                do_deploy

                step.

                Since kirkstone tasks have network access disabled by default so
                we need

                to enable it explicitly for tasks that talk to the signing
                service.

      body: |
        This new version of the tegra186_tx2_6.dtb file
        adds the "nvidia,rx_frames" element to the "ether_qos" block.

        Alexandru: I moved the dtb added by Todd from the root
        of the respository to the jetson-dtbs package, so it
        can be included in the next image releases.

        This is a rebase of https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson/pull/438

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which
                unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit,
                openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is
                found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the
                layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in `chrony.conf`
                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony
                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start
                if that's the case.

                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens
                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and
                hitting this problem.

                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the
                start to avoid the race condition.

                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony
                does (see
                https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony/blob/7b197953e8add5515b7e58c4638dc55aa4bb91b7/conf.c#L1761)

                support

                hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.


                This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the
                branch

                selection logic to cover some corner cases.


                It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

                The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in

                d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


                Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in
                Poky:

                e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e

                Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in
                Poky:

                66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


                This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is
                reverted here as

                it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all
                the

                possible ABIs build with this change.

                        The 243390 device specific tests assess that the hotspot
                        connection is created on the intended interface. We thus
                        need to ensure that the connection to the testbot is
                        established using the embedded wifi chip.

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is
                        linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to
                        switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot
                directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to
                include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE =
                "kernel-image-*"`

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for
                ppc64le

                systems and is not present in older Yocto releases.


                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust
                architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support
                such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be
                called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                With Kirkstone and the support of openSSL 3.0 it's not possible
                to find

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications
                across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across
                all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting
                that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.


                These rust recipes come from Poky Kirkstone

                Recent versions of meta-balena include a balena-rust layer used
                to

                specify a distro-set Rust version across all supported Yocto
                versions


                As such, the syntax of this layer also needs to be converted.

              body: >
                Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a
                new

                container. This had two downsides:


                1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load,
                it would
                   sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
                   watchdog.
                2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves
                writing
                   some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
                   wearing the storage media.

                This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and
                `containerd`, which

                is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write
                to disk.

                The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have
                seen at

                least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but

                `containerd` wasn't.

      body: |
        The `state` field in device-type.json is no longer used by the cloud,
        it's enough to set the hostapp as `is_archived`.

        However, until we stop using device-type.json it would be confusing not
        to update the state field.

        In commit 853224bd12f21175e273aedbc0466ac19e3aec25
        we brought in the kernel recipe from meta-tegra
        to fix a initramfs issue in L4T 32.7.2, until we
        will have Kirkstone support in meta-balena. Currently
        we use Honister for the device integration layers
        and meta-tegra 32.7.2 which is compatible with Kirkstone 4.0
        and Langdale 4.1.

                files

                to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

                Use a common function to apply settings in config.json to avoid
                code duplication. It also provides timed results so we know
                how long it took to apply a setting.

                        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying
                        on failure. In

                        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud
                        test suite, we

                        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised
                        immediately. Other

                        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries
                        and interval to

                        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these
                        methods to allow

                        for this behavior to be configured.

                When parallelizing fingerprint checks with Promise.any(), the

                unsuccessful command would continue retrying in the background,
                causing

                spurious error messages.


                With mDNS resolution memoization, this optimization no longer
                saves us

                time, so remove it.

                BALENA_BOOT_MOUNTPOINT is used in 32 places in the OS, while

                BOOT_MOUNTPOINT is used in 5.


                This commit replaces BOOT_MOUNTPOINT with BALENA_BOOT_MOUNTPOINT
                to

                remove the duplication.

                When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key
                is

                required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device
                through

                the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a
                QEMU

                instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct
                path, and

                no VPN is necessary.


                Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not
                specified. This

                allows direct connections to work without it.

                We may have cases when for some boards we do not want
                to have all these files blacklisted. See for example
                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-rockpi/commit/b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169

                In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed

                This changes the condition in the unit file from checking
                whether

                /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether
                /mnt/boot/EFI

                is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition
                populating

                the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link
                is

                not present when the service is started (after the boot
                partition is mounted),

                the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


                The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a
                symlink

                if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case
                there is a single

                boot partition. That said the service is only started when
                necessary

                and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount
                script.

                Recent versions of GRUB default to use shim_lock when in secure
                boot mode.

                We do not use shim and do not build the shim_lock module into
                GRUB EFI binary

                therefore this needs to be disabled.

                Add a healthcheck that will check that the NTP sources are
                reachable

                and the system time does not skew.


                The healthcheck will command a burst sync if there is no
                selected

                reachable source, and will restart chronyd if the system clock
                skews.


                Fixes #2314

                When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where
                config.json

                is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but
                /run/dnsmasq.servers is

                not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is
                not empty.

                    not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.
                      ---

                Fix this by waiting until the InvocationID of dnsmasq.service
                changes.

                Also, let's make sure an error is thrown when the hostapp cannot
                be made public.

              hash: 6175420731baa349c8d197151189462a23b2f460
              body: >
                This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for
                ipv4 to

                infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond
                to DHCP

                requests in time.


                This however causes issues on some routers, which after power
                cycle fail to

                renew leases after they are expired.


                The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection
                basis. Since

                the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more
                common case,

                it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified.
                If the

                setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the
                particular

                connection profile.

                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out
                during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs
                migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of
                containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing
                further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the
                Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings
                distributed with

                the Moby project.

                      hash: 59f6cd6dc32ee178532dbf7595933ef606cebf39
                      body: >
                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on
                        delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta
                        indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with
                        distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration
                        tests.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                  scripts/basic/fixdep: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34'

              body: >
                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when
                secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the
                kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file
                that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it
                and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no
                point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel
                to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back
                and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of
                the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                This caters for the use case of custom device types that are not

                registered in balena-cloud but still need to fetch the
                supervisor from

                balena-cloud's registry by querying the `supervisor_version`
                endpoint,

                for example when using openBalena.

                For balena-cloud managed devices, the supervisor update data is
                managed

                by the API.


                Providing the image name in the command line provides an update
                path

                for unmanaged devices, manual updates on ESR devices (which
                currently

                do not allow dashboard based updates) and openBalena use cases.

                The issue that this test is aimed at has been introduced in

                kernel versions above 4.13. On older kernels like for instance

                4.9, the test will not pass.


                Let's run this test on kernel versions where the issue was
                present.

                Since https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f
                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,
                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing
                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible
                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the
                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the
                failed check in the above mentioned patch.

                Since we are not using the functions provided
                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this
                config.

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition
                names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in
                resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state
                symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after
                provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in
                the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot
                order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the
                resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully
                locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a
                secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                As per https://jel.ly.fish/a533a6bd-1c98-412c-ae60-8427e3f7b005,
                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json
                changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to
                the unit

                This commit removes all config-json.target instances in
                preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                boot,

                we made it unreachable on first boot. We must not exit the

                after resizing the partition only because that way the resizing

                is only finished on 2nd boot.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't
                touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem
                again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is
                always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already
                filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

              body: >
                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd
                chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not
                cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory,
                so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift
                file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency
                from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to
                the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the
                NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust

                As resin-rootA is used to decide whether to re-run the

                last. As it stands, if resin-rootA is regenerated by any other

                On transitioning from the initramfs to the rootfs, the udev
                database is

                cleanedup as the rules between initramfs and rootfs might defer.


                However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we
                need to

                set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

                This is needed because the rules in the final rootfs might be

                different than the one in the initramfs.


                Devices that need to persist, like dm devices, need to be
                flagged with

                the `db_persist` option.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use
                /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is
                recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems
                for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not
                re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may
                implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains
                backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

      body: |
        We temporarily remove the following community device types
        that have not been released in the dashboard because updates
        have not been submitted by community maintainers in order
        to keep up with newer L4T releases.

        We cannot release images for these devices types without updated
        L4T device-trees or configuration files that are specific to them.

        These can be added back an released to the dashboard when updates
        for L4T 32.6.1 or newer are submitted.

    - subject: "hostapp-update-hooks: improve rollback-health on older tx2 images"
      hash: 6fbea8db185ed2791aea87df8e04e84c27341598
      body: >
        In this commit we improve the old update hook that exists in L4T 28.X

        based systems to allow reverting to the old 28.x partition layout.


        Images that were releases on L4T 28.1, 28.2 etc did not support
        re-creating

        the partition layout in case of a rollback, because the new 32.X layout

        was not known at that point, and we were not aware that there could

        be situations in which connectivity problems could cause the system

        to roll back to an inconsistent state.


        We therefore fix this, so in case the new L4T 32.6 based OS encounters

        connectivity or engine related issues and rolls back, the updated hook

        in the old OS re-writes the partition layout in the corresponding 28.x
        format,

        with the offsets expected by the old tegra-bootloaders, thus allowing
        the

        system to fully revert to the old OS.

    - subject: Avoid MB1 bootloader debug mode
      hash: 8ddf7969dccda8746e880285be5b2d807b5808d0
      body: |
        In the current form, rollback-altboot from
        32.6.1 to 32.6.1 works on the AGX, however,
        if performed from 32.5.1 to the newer one,
        MB1 puts the device in debug mode instead
        of loading bootloaders from the old slot.

        The solution to this problem is to write
        both slots with 32.6.1 and just leave the
        kernel and kernel-dtb partitions on 32.5.1.

        This makes MB1 successfully load the inactive
        slots. For details see github link in this
        commit.

      body: |
        Starting with 32.6.1, when the device is provisioned, the
        flashing tools perform bpmp trimming by default, based on
        a value read from the device, which is 0. If however
        the files are signed without being written, the bpmp
        dtb is not trimmed and the boot blob is generated
        incorrectly (wrong offsets).
        Therefore we now tell the flashing tools to trim
        the bpmp dtb using the default ramcode, which is also 0,
        as the one that's being read from our device.

                The balena-build.sh script accepts a token in the command line.
                This

                commit modifies the prepare-and-start.sh script to use it if

                available, and also modifies it to take into account the balena

                environment too.

                For the time being we are still using a version label in the

                This commit will be reverted once we get rid of the version

                reject deployments for an existing release.


                On the new versioning model, deployments increment a revision

                there is no need to check for uniqueness.

                use of release_version.


                Introduce a new balena_lib_release() function that utilises a

                contract and the CLI to set the release version.

                we eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be
                identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we
                want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which
                must match

                the name of the associated file.

                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the
                system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to
                request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check
                (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No
                Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have
                full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive
                portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the
                current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to
                be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust
                the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate
                for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received.
                Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s
                and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the
                maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for
                devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access
                is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a
                few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait
                target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and
                that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific
                interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back.
                However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken
                for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of
                2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is
                not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we
                are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already
                mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since
                not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                The change overwrites build files, though that is what we need,
                it is a hacky

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux
                kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load
                the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by
                a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                ones"
              hash: 853656e6bcfed0b0206d031c32cd1cde811b8146
              body: >
                Currently the two classes would keep the original files
                untouched and store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic -
                the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is
                stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned
                files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does
                not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                When a device is running in secure boot mode, it must not be
                possible to HUP

                to an unsigned version of the OS because UEFI would refuse to
                boot it before

                any of our self-recovering rollback mechanisms can be triggered.
                This would

                effectively brick the device, needing physical access to
                recover.

                Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that
                would start

                up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the
                connectivity

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the
                testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the
                worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being
                tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and
                size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can
                be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

                purged if the remove_me_to_reset file is removed.

                The Rock Pi 4B uses a file named hw_intf.conf for

                Just noting that the syntax is also slightly different
                from the config.txt file on RaspberryPi.

                Let's blacklist this file to avoid overriding
                it during an OS update.

              body: |
                When user namespacing was enabled in the kernel by default, a separate
                commit [0] was introduced to disable the feature at runtime, to allow
                users/administrators to explicitly choose to enable it, avoiding
                potential security implications.

                However, some applications such as Chromium's sandbox, require either
                SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards
                that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and
                potentially breaks previously working applications.

                Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

                This avoids the kernel printing debug messages on the consoles.
                It is

                also the default in other upstream distros like Ubuntu.

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache
                to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have
                its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants
                during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the
                same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should
                fix the issue.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were
                previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature
                also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures
                the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for
                BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development
                images into

                a single image.

                The extlinux.conf file path in meta-balena is currently

                incorrect, let's update it's boot partition path so that

                BalenaHUP won't need to transfer the isolcpus setting to

                the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from
                older

                OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                Some OS versions before HUP do not support the '-b all' flag
                to journalctl. This commit reverts to the original behaviour
                that lists the boots and requests the logs for each boot.

                        Some recent changes to the OS allowed some services to

                        automatically when the associated config files are

                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same
                        services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                      body: |
                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to
                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)
                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling
                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored
                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the
                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.

                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor
                        journal logs as

                        ```
                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```

                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image
                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the
                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the
                        database should be side effect free.

                        and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction
                        by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.

                        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future
                        release_uuid)


                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it
                        doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by
                        supervisor API and for state

                        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for
                        calculating steps to target state.

                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker
                        IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if
                        the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the
                        supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to
                        tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to
                        ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the
                        engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal
                        operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the
                        image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on
                        information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by
                        docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the
                        same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex
                        instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running
                        tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just
                        removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                We no longer require a reboot when changing the NTP server
                configuration in config.json. Changes to 'config-json' will
                automatically trigger the 'balena-ntp-config' service which will
                update the NTP sources.

                Since adding the 'config-json' systemd target the
                'balena-ntp-config'

                and 'prepare-openvpn' services have stopped running
                automatically

                when config.json is updated. This is fixed by adding

                'RemainAfterExit=yes' to both service files.

                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing
                enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and
                Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in
                the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more
                conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the
                kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of
                application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally
                unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max
                number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but
                without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as
                RHEL, in

                Having the lines limited to 500 meant we were missing
                a lot of logs.

                We also don't need to list boots and can use the 'all'
                arguement to see all logs.

                In recent kernels (i.e. 5.10.31 for Raspberry Pi) the

                596b0474d3d9b1242eab713f84d8873f9887d980 for details.


                Hence we use in meta-balena-dunfell the upstream kernel-devsrc
                from the

                hardknott-3.3.1 Poky release which handles this module.lds move.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for
                        cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in
                        `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries
                        (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download
                        anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                This target service can be used to restart other services
                that have explicitly set themselves as PartOf this target.

                So a service that should be restarted when config.json changes
                can use PartOf=config-json.target to be triggered automatically.

                This avoids a compile error on kernel 5.10.31 on arm64

                undefined because the older gcc in the
                intel-nuc-debian:stretch-20190717

                Resolve `latest` to dev variant


                If we want the serial logs of the DUT the image that is flashed
                needs to

                be the development variant. The `latest` shortcut however always

                resolves to the production image. We manually resolve the
                version to fix

                this.

                the partition sizes on the balena image classes.


                The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total
                BalenaOS

                size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB
                partitions. The

                data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage
                media.


                Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

              hash: a6781d54c6edced457ad916cac3fec9c70d25a0a
              body: >
                Add a new systemd service to check for full network
                connectivity.

                This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)

                connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the

                CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states.
                This

                service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be
                used

                to delay the start of other services which require full network

                access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems
                on

                networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.


                The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make
                sure

                that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is

                redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is
                started

                before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The
                initial

                check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the
                script

                standalone or post-boot.


                Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait
                for

                full network connectivity should add the following entries to
                their

                systemd unit definition:


                Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the engine
                unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in unit for
                reference.

                Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts those
                overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it would be
                possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without remounting
                the rootfs to be writeable.

                See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#System%20Unit%20Search%20Path

                Simplify this makefile by passing the kernel source directory to

              hash: d965d23fe60db6254eaabd81a0d48b5718e01a3a

                The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update
                step

                when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the
                balena

                supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.


                This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a

                oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not
                exist

                in the new path before starting the supervisor.

                This commit brings the bluez5 recipe from poky master as we need
                to control which bluez5 version is used in meta-balena.

                The code originates from poky's master branch -

                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device
                into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet,
                and Go

                1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now
                to fix
                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update
                our

                build before upgrading further.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing
                string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable
                rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly
                when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json
                itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager
                script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
                      body: >
                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam
                        config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for
                        each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if
                        the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because
                        that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in
                        local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new
                        one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the
                        logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures,
                        it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided
                        network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an
                        earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets
                        to a point it

                        can be used.

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version
                        no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on
                        supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with
                        livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be
                immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

      body: >
        The upstream recipe has removed the master branch and replaced it with

        main. When specifying the SRC_URI with a sha1, the OE fetcher will
        assume

        the master branch and fail with:


        libnvidia-container-tools-0.9.0-r1 do_fetch: Fetcher failure: Unable to
        find revision d97c08af5061f1516fb2e3a26508936f69d6d71d in branch master
        even from upstream


        This commit specifies the upstream branch as main.

                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run
                until we

                configure the engine service to include an
                `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`

                env var.


                The other notable change is the fix for

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which
                allows

                `balena top` to work as expected on balenaOS

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before
                sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this
                we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on
                ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and
                querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed
                in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will
                be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

              hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2

                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and
                resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the
                resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount
                point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it
                had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time
                at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next
                boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not
                run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been
                performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS
                image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the
                device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue
                is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much
                every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop
                devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch
                updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or
                change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own
                service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when
                the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would
                cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load
                service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution
                of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded)
                and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state,
                requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script
                itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely,
                skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition,
                and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to
                ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're
                building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This
                had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases,
                such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps
                of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append
                the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub
                image

                without any external modules at all.

                If the device with flasher rootfs is slow to bring up and rootfs
                is defined

                as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would
                assume UUIDs have

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead.
                This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated
                UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                sources to

                when it starts up or at runtime using the chrony-helper script.


                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network
                interface

                comes back up.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

            - subject: replace busybox ps with procps [klutchell]
              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
              body: |
                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing
                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat
                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.

                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args
                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this
                when compiled in "desktop" mode.

                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into
                a separate procps package:

                - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90

                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches
                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

        cboot from 32.4.4 now includes a few extra patches from
        the meta-tegra layer, and this breaks boot after HUP on the

        Update bindiff for signed boot blob to address this.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Upstream changes to the kernel have switched to a shared x86
                insn decoder required by tools/objtool so we must add those
                include and lib components to our target dir.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                the supervisor database was relocated by mistake. On this version the database
                returns to its original place, and these hooks copy the old database to the
                new location to avoid data loss.

                We have no use for u-boot-initial-env and enabling it would require
                additional changes in do_compile to match the commit linked above.

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior
                to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1
                removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable.
                Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no
                config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this
                problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if
                necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the
                script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a
                fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both
                ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a
                privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing
                the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both
                network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as
                follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging
                of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                        ```

                        version: '2.1'

                        services:
                          app_1:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_2:

                        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image
                        database entries

                        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the
                        engine handles this

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the
                        removal process

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor
                        currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal -
                        MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as
                        much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of
                        `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage
                        seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much
                        greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree -
                        Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free`
                        commands.

                        In order to make supervisor upgrades more transparent,

                        from this env var since it requires a container restart
                        any time the supervisor

                        is upgraded. We should ultimately move towards providing
                        the supervisors

                        set of capabilities, but that can come later

                        during database initialization due to a circular

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the
                        supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See
                        #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration,
                        which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when
                        no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor
                        API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to
                        specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the
                        application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud
                        API when in

                        managed mode.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP
                request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls
                (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been
                added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP
                requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due
                to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the

                In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log
                messages:

                a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a
                reboot, and

                b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.


                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift
                file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot
                process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that
                result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated
                when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has
                been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time
                from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system
                time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g.
                power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

                This is resolved by not adding the default dependency on the

                The hostapp update process should not overwrite the supervisor

                target state

                after HUP and reboot the device during the rollback period.


                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the
                only ones

                that force a reboot.

                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena
                symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs
                leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

                We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA
                key

                of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement
                support

                if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA
                bundle

                so that the CA is respected everywhere.

                        Due to switching to Alpine the ability to resolve mDNS
                        hostnames was lost. This patch overrides the lookup and
                        manually resolves the names.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted
                                        once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right
                                        now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get
                                        this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be
                                        re-written soon.

                information is maintained in the flasher image itself, so until
                that is

                sorted stop reporting a blank string for the supervisor version.

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
                underneath it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor
                reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to
                fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative
                priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are
                exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt
                line is not

                connected.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace
                to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded
                release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the

                stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more
                info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level
                version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to
                update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started,
                otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify
                this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as
                well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the
                system.


                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in
                udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API introduced
                        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.

                        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of
                        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.
                        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:
                        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

                        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but
                        still having to pass

                        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db
                        module and have

                        access to the database handle.

                mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev
                database

                is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not
                detected

                by systemd.


                This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common
                to all

                the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the
                initramfs that

                creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that
                enables it.

              hash: 034ff61a58f30a980514157412c0455b52ddf744
              body: >
                When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is
                a

                pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool

                URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server'
                and

                'burst' commands.


                To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into
                the

                'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this

                option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been
                present

                since v1.25 released in 2011.


                This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command
                line

                running on a RPi3.

                Devices with closed source bootloaders that cannot be made to
                pass the UUID

                of the booting device (like smartphones, Jetson NX and Xabier),
                need to

                fallback to passing a label in the kernel command line.


                Fixes #1905

              body: >
                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the
                root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and
                device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which
                probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                The power save has been switched from 'off' to 'on' in adf69fb
                with no apparent motivation, we consider it an oversight
                and the desired state is 'off'.

                Fixes #1850

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor
                        api port` and

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful
                        firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling
                        is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT,
                        so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

                        sync-debug.js.


                        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush
                        process

                        with the supervisor on a device.

                        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml
                        file.


                        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed
                        moving forward, and were

                        only to enable livepush builds.

                        failed (permanently unavailable);

                        This change makes sure we are cycling until a random

                creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes
                as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

                balenaOS uses FAT as a fs type for the boot/first partition.
                This is

                currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs
                built in

                the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel
                modules in

                the initramfs (when needed).

                so that systemd won't directly kill the user containers first.

                ppp version is 2.4.7. Without defining the right path, the path
                defaults

                to v2.4.5 in NM configure scripts.


                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with
                reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5
                misleading

                some debug effort

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond
                this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce
                unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              hash: b4122eeea971dfc9325885cc7c896c733cf60920
              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the
                timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The
                default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS
                requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only
                applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the
                normal

                functionality.

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                Reports indicate that NetworkManager can leave stale temporary
                files on

                the state partition that over time can affect the device's
                operability.


                This commit removes the timestamps.XXXXXX and seen-bssids.XXXXXX
                files on

                startup to avoid this situation.

              body: >
                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                ESR releases have the VERSION string in /etc/os-release in a
                date

                format. 2019.10.0 etc.

                We added META_BALENA_VERSION in os-release from v2.38.0 via

                b0e0c77a26f3fad51e2923ab416fdd2af2a5a033


                Lets use META_BALENA_VERSION if available for our os version
                checks.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is

                production

                images, the system doesn't boot. Traced to initramfs not

                process such as udev with the right file descripters for 0,1,2


                Add workaround for that issue. This got exposed with a systemd

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the
                system

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not
                available).

                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h
                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena
                daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container

                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and will come
                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.

                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped handling
                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device: disable
                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only the
                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface will
                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default route for
                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in balenaOS.
                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which is coming from
                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the DISTRO_VERSION.
                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to
                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.
