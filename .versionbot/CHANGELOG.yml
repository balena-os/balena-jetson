                udev initialization.

                Building it as module ensures that dummy
                devices are not needlessly created during boot.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is

                When `console=null` is passed in the kernel cmdline for
                production

                images, the system doesn't boot. Traced to initramfs not
                starting any

                process such as udev with the right file descripters for 0,1,2


                Add workaround for that issue. This got exposed with a systemd

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the
                system

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena
                daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container

                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly
                but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For
                example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and
                will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.
