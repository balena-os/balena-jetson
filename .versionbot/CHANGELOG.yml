        These were needed to deliver an urgent OS image,
        now meta-balena updates the firmware recipe so
        we can drop these changes.

        This reverts commit e96dc8e because it is no longer
        necessary.

                The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update
                step

                when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the
                balena

                supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.


                This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a

                oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not
                exist

                in the new path before starting the supervisor.

                Since bluez 5.35, the bluetooth daemon has the ability to power
                on

                controllers instead of using the unreliable `hciconfig hci0 up`.

                This commit makes this the default for BalenaOS.

                The unit file is left with a placeholder to perform the
                substitution.

                Previously this was replaced by autoconf.

                This commit brings the bluez5 recipe from poky master as we need
                to control which bluez5 version is used in meta-balena.

                The code originates from poky's master branch -
                c887238347295c87dacf8a08e6d703603436d0bc.

              hash: ac0ba89f14c0b04b7353192f15a0634be44d910c
              body: >
                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device
                into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet,
                and Go

                1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now
                to fix
                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update
                our

                build before upgrading further.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing
                string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable
                rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly
                when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json
                itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager
                script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                        Show warning instead of exception for invalid network
                        config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a

                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam
                        config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for
                        each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if
                        the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because
                        that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in
                        local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new
                        one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the
                        logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures,
                        it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided
                        network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an
                        earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets
                        to a point it

                        can be used.

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version
                        no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on
                        supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with
                        livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be
                immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

        The upstream recipe has removed the master branch and replaced it with

        main. When specifying the SRC_URI with a sha1, the OE fetcher will
        assume

        the master branch and fail with:


        libnvidia-container-tools-0.9.0-r1 do_fetch: Fetcher failure: Unable to
        find revision d97c08af5061f1516fb2e3a26508936f69d6d71d in branch master
        even from upstream


        This commit specifies the upstream branch as main.

                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run

                `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`

                env var.


                The other notable change is the fix for

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before
                sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this
                we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on
                ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and
                querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed
                in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will
                be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

                resin-mounts/etc-fake-hwclock: add dependency on resin-state
                services
              hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2
              body: >
                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and
                resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the
                resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount
                point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it
                had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time
                at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next
                boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not
                run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been
                performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS
                image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the
                device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue
                is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much
                every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop
                devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch
                updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or
                change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own
                service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when
                the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would
                cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load
                service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution
                of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded)
                and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state,
                requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script
                itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely,
                skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition,
                and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to
                ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're
                building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This
                had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases,
                such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps
                of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append
                the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub
                image

                without any external modules at all.

                This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated
                UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

              hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

        Poky Dunfell is using Go v1.14 while meta-balena is still in v1.12. The

        build flags for the time being.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
              body: >
                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of
                this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary
                into

                a separate procps package:


                -
                https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into
                compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than
                gatesgarth.

        cboot from 32.4.4 now includes a few extra patches from

        Update bindiff for signed boot blob to address this.

            - subject: Fix pppd timeout when launched by NetworkManager
              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

              body: >
                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                The fix for TUNE_FEATURES parsing has been merged in meta-rust
                master

                and should be present when they fork for dunfell.

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior
                to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1
                removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable.
                Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no
                config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this
                problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if
                necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the
                script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a
                fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both
                ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a
                privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing
                the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both
                network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as
                follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging
                of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                Add the u-blox-modeswitch scripts to modemmanager. The scripts
                are

                generic and therefore it makes sense to provide them as part of

                meta-balena instead of balena-raspberrypi.

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor
                        currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal -
                        MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as
                        much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of
                        `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage
                        seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much
                        greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree -
                        Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free`
                        commands.

                        updates in system information would not be sent to the

                        (although this does

                        not mean that we will be sending data that often, we
                        still only send the

                        delta, if one exists)

                        In order to make supervisor upgrades more transparent,
                        lets move away

                        from this env var since it requires a container restart
                        any time the supervisor

                        is upgraded. We should ultimately move towards providing
                        the supervisors

                        set of capabilities, but that can come later

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the
                        supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See
                        #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration,
                        which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when
                        no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor
                        API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to
                        specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the
                        application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud
                        API when in

                        managed mode.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP
                request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls
                (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been
                added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP
                requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due
                to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the
                timeinit-rtc

                service.

                systemd/timeinit: add fake.hwclock to maintain system time over
                reboots

              body: >
                In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log
                messages:

                a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a
                reboot, and

                b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.


                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift
                file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot
                process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that
                result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated
                when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has
                been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time
                from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system
                time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g.
                power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

                With the data partition being mounted in the initramfs to
                support host

                extensions, the runtime systemd-udev no longer sees the
                resin-data mount

                event and this mount is blocked.


                This is resolved by not adding the default dependency on the
                block device.

                The hostapp update process should not overwrite the supervisor
                configuration

                backend files to avoid the supervisor being forced to set the
                target state

                after HUP and reboot the device during the rollback period.


                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the
                only ones

                that force a reboot.

            - subject: Wait for the root device to come up when necessary
              hash: 494eeb4a699b4dd5e48547d6e5e45cffb7bf0720
              body: >
                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena
                symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs
                leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

              hash: 2218cb21d1fc813ac59c08b77046c5d014ad9a42
              body: >
                We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA
                key

                of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement
                support

                if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA
                bundle

                so that the CA is respected everywhere.


                Fixes #1398

                                The change type is considered 'major' because,
                                by default, errors are

                                now thrown for relatively common occurrences
                                such as authentication

                                failures when pulling from private registries,
                                and library users may

                                have to adapt.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted
                                        once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right
                                        now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get
                                        this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be
                                        re-written soon.

                                Handlebars supports very basic if condition
                                checking, but it only checks for

                                existence of a field. There are times when we
                                want to combine conditions in order

                                without defining a completely separate

                                blueprint for it (like generating network config
                                schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

                                a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
                underneath it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor
                reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to
                fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative
                priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are
                exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt
                line is not

                connected.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace
                to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded
                release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the

                stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more
                info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level
                version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to
                update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started,
                otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify
                this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as
                well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the

                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in
                udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                                        Because of this, the upsert() method is

                                        supported when Pinejs ^10.19.0 is used.

                        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the
                        DeviceRequest API introduced

                        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a
                        feature label.


                        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the
                        default behavior of

                        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the
                        `gpu` capabilty.

                        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA
                        driver; here:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

                        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but
                        still having to pass

                        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db
                        module and have

                        access to the database handle.

                This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory
                or 1GB,

                whichever smallest.


                Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in
                warrior, and a

                new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in
                BalenaOS as

                we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS.
                The

                mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev
                database

                is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not
                detected

                by systemd.


                This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common
                to all

                the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the
                initramfs that

                creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that
                enables it.

              hash: 034ff61a58f30a980514157412c0455b52ddf744

                When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is
                a

                pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool

                URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server'
                and

                'burst' commands.


                To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into
                the

                'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this

                option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been
                present

                since v1.25 released in 2011.


                This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command
                line

                running on a RPi3.

              body: >
                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run
                is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the
                root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and
                device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which
                probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor
                        api port` and

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful
                        firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling
                        is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT,
                        so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

                        The coverage no longer works with es2020, and nobody

                        sync-debug.js.


                        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush
                        process

                        with the supervisor on a device.

                        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml

                        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed
                        moving forward, and were

                        only to enable livepush builds.

              body: >
                When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks
                whether the

                device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed
                in the

                kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it
                creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes
                as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

                This is

                currently hardcoded so let's have the related kernel configs
                built in

                the kernel image. In this way we don't have to handle kernel
                modules in

                ppp version is 2.4.7. Without defining the right path, the path

                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with
                reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5
                misleading

                some debug effort

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond
                this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce
                unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the
                timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The
                default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS
                requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only
                applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the
                normal

                functionality.

            - subject: Increase NTP polling time to around 4.5 hours.
              hash: 4a47b9297b37277a9aece0ea322e706dbe473f12

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5
                hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to
                specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two
                number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s
                (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this
                configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a
                state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs,
                the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have
                to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up
                directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make
                it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with
                the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

                Fixes #1630


                Need to make the script go in the background in ExecStartPost=.

                Otherwise, the service status never gets to active/running
                resulting

                it in remaining stuck in an endless loop.


                If the health-check load fails for whatever reason, the
                subsequent

                engine healthcheck will fail retriggering the healthcheck load.

                Add dummy net driver support, which is used to
                check if a container is privileged during
                udev initialization.

                Building it as module ensures that dummy
                devices are not needlessly created during boot.

                Make uboot dev images autoboot delay build time configurable.
                Default is no delay

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                fd1 and fd2. And assign them to /dev/null if unavailable.

                The default driver is cgroupfs. We switch to systemd so that

                Otherwise, systemd will have its own cgroup manager and cgroupfs

                be another cgroup manager via balenaEngine daemon.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

                We have found a rare corner case bug where the journal bloats
                beyond

                its limit and fills the state partition. Triggering a vacuum on
                reboot

                helps a bit in case the device is restarted to recover its
                function.


                Fixes #1423

                The fix for this appears to be switching the modem with
                vid and pid 12d1:1f01 from the cdc_ether legacy mode to
                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                to get it in the previous layers as well.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena
                daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container


                Fixes #1391

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about
                61M on

                the pi3. We compress the data partition later on so don't notice
                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                Fixes #1564


                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

            - subject: Persist bluetooth storage data over reboots
              hash: 3815e42f24167c0ce84a39cf0653434bacb0bd88

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.
