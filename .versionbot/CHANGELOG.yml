              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: >
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and

                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at

                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.

                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322


                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:


                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to

                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

              body: >
                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is fixed
                upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being used.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM devices are
                still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM devices are
                still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression ratio.

              body: >
                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI partition).

                Not all the boards we support have the redsocks uid as 995 in their rootfs
                so let's

                fetch the actual redsocks uid from the DUT before running the proxy tests and

                update that in the docker-compose.yml. We do so because the REDSOCKS_UID value

                isn't substituted in the compose if the variable, even if it is passed trough

                the cli.

                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option, but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD is also

                missing.

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts

                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be

                        considered.

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                        timeout too in 15 seconds:


                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Run ssh from the worker to test local SSH authentication with a cloud

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                types. This is a frequently requested by customers and will avoid having

                to patch individual device repositories.

                There are two sets of keys used in this test, one stored in `/root/id`

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server, and

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct private key.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for local

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the do_deploy

                step.

                Since kirkstone tasks have network access disabled by default so we need

      body: |
        This new version of the tegra186_tx2_6.dtb file
        adds the "nvidia,rx_frames" element to the "ether_qos" block.

        Alexandru: I moved the dtb added by Todd from the root
        of the respository to the jetson-dtbs package, so it
        can be included in the next image releases.

        This is a rebase of https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson/pull/438

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
                `chrony.conf`

                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

                if that's the case.


                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

                hitting this problem.


                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

                start to avoid the race condition.


                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

                does (see

                https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony/blob/7b197953e8add5515b7e58c4638dc55aa4bb91b7/conf.c#L1761)

                The task that applies the aufs patches is still required to support

                hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.


                This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the branch

                selection logic to cover some corner cases.


                It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

                The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in Poky:

                d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


                Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in Poky:

                e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e


                Only to be re-introduced, also without much explanation in Poky:

                0bf2fd16273436f1cd9ea2ab99ad882e879f965d


                Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in Poky:

                66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


                This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is reverted here as

                it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all the

                possible ABIs build with this change.

                        The 243390 device specific tests assess that the hotspot
                        connection is created on the intended interface. We thus
                        need to ensure that the connection to the testbot is
                        established using the embedded wifi chip.

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                        publish the current setting.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "kernel-image-*"`

                versions so include the fetcher conditionally.

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for ppc64le

                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.

                Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a new

                container. This had two downsides:


                1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load, it would
                   sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
                   watchdog.
                2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves writing
                   some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
                   wearing the storage media.

                This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and `containerd`, which

                is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write to disk.

                The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have seen at

                least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but

                `containerd` wasn't.

                This is a small improvement over our previous test: in addition to

                checking that the volumes themselves are preserved over HUPs, we now

                check if the contents of these volumes is preserved.

      body: |
        The `state` field in device-type.json is no longer used by the cloud,
        it's enough to set the hostapp as `is_archived`.

        However, until we stop using device-type.json it would be confusing not
        to update the state field.

        In commit 853224bd12f21175e273aedbc0466ac19e3aec25
        we brought in the kernel recipe from meta-tegra
        to fix a initramfs issue in L4T 32.7.2, until we
        will have Kirkstone support in meta-balena. Currently
        we use Honister for the device integration layers
        and meta-tegra 32.7.2 which is compatible with Kirkstone 4.0
        and Langdale 4.1.

                The boot partition is currently a FAT filesystem that does not support

                atomic writes. To prevent corruption, this commit introduces a fatrw

                application that needs to be used both when reading and writing files

                to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

                      hash: 2f2d7a8b99fcaffc22d0032f9102e194160f7e1f
                      body: >
                        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying on failure. In

                        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we

                        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other

                        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to

                        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow

                        for this behavior to be configured.

                When parallelizing fingerprint checks with Promise.any(), the

                unsuccessful command would continue retrying in the background, causing

                spurious error messages.


                With mDNS resolution memoization, this optimization no longer saves us

                time, so remove it.

                When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key is

                required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device through

                the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a QEMU

                instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct path, and

                no VPN is necessary.


                Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not specified. This

                allows direct connections to work without it.

                We may have cases when for some boards we do not want

                In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed

                so that users of meta-balena can alter this list as they see fit.

                This changes the condition in the unit file from checking whether

                /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether /mnt/boot/EFI

                is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition populating

                the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link is

                not present when the service is started (after the boot partition is mounted),

                the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


                The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a symlink

                if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case there is a single

                boot partition. That said the service is only started when necessary

                and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount script.

              hash: dd0c128664a4b5cb004cd154f4dabc627d1f6e77
              body: >
                Recent versions of GRUB default to use shim_lock when in secure boot mode.

                We do not use shim and do not build the shim_lock module into GRUB EFI binary

                therefore this needs to be disabled.

                        Create a directConnect variable that indicates whether we're connecting

                        over a unix domain socket. This allows the suite to skip steps that

                        don't pertain to local runs.

                Add a healthcheck that will check that the NTP sources are reachable

                and the system time does not skew.


                The healthcheck will command a burst sync if there is no selected

                reachable source, and will restart chronyd if the system clock skews.


                Fixes #2314

                As part of rebranding, resin docker repos were renamed to balena, and

                resin/resin-img no longer receives updates. Change the image we pull to

                process OS images from resin/resin-img to balena/balena-img.

                When the promise called in waitUntil fails, the function defaults to a

                maximum 5m retry window in the cloud suite.

                When tests execute quicker, a race condition can occur where config.json

                is edited to remove the dnsServers property, but /run/dnsmasq.servers is

                not changed yet. This causes the test to fail, as the file is not empty.

                    not ok 1 - We should have an empty /run/dnsmasq.servers file.

                Git 2.35.2 was released to fix a security issue with multi-user
                machines. Add `device_dir` to the whitelist to avoid this error.

                Also, let's make sure an error is thrown when the hostapp cannot
                be made public.

                This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for ipv4 to

                infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond to DHCP

                requests in time.


                This however causes issues on some routers, which after power cycle fail to

                renew leases after they are expired.


                The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection basis. Since

                the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more common case,

                it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified. If the

                setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the particular

                connection profile.

                Commit 445d6d1fcfce97f85ffcfedc0083eb658a734321 does not fix
                the issue because it is missing the --global arg without which
                the git config command fails.

              body: >
                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings distributed with

                the Moby project.

                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration tests.

                Starting with v2.91.6 device provisioning will not start if the device

                was unable to register in the cloud due to lack of internet connectivity.

                To avoid this, we switch to retrying 3 times with the usual 2 second delay

                between attempts, after which the flashing process will start.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                  scripts/basic/fixdep: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34'

              body: >
                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel patch
                backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                Should this happen, we use sgdisk to check and recover the end gpt

                for example when using openBalena.

                do not allow dashboard based updates) and openBalena use cases.

                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to the unit

                or not.


                This commit removes all config-json.target instances in preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                In order to avoid the need to unlock encrypted partitions in GRUB we want

                to use a custom stage2 bootloader. Since that is not ready yet, emulate that

                by copying flasher kernel to the EFI partition, start it from GRUB, have it

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into it.

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

                jq is used in the bootfiles hostapp-update
                hook for accessing config.json, which may have
                one of the modification dates invalid,
                as we've seen during testing. We thus need to
                avoid performing a touch on config.json
                to avoid reloading of containers.

              body: >
                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory, so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Poky releases older than Honister should stick to rust v1.36
                which has been used in balenaOS builds so far.

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust
                version to use the Honister syntax.

                However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we need to

                set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

                This is needed because the rules in the final rootfs might be

                Devices that need to persist, like dm devices, need to be flagged with

                the `db_persist` option.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                The CM4 IO-Board was the first device
                which exhibited an issue in which
                the MAC address was set to an
                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

        We temporarily remove the following community device types
        that have not been released in the dashboard because updates
        have not been submitted by community maintainers in order
        to keep up with newer L4T releases.

        We cannot release images for these devices types without updated
        L4T device-trees or configuration files that are specific to them.

        These can be added back an released to the dashboard when updates
        for L4T 32.6.1 or newer are submitted.

      hash: 6fbea8db185ed2791aea87df8e04e84c27341598
      body: >
        In this commit we improve the old update hook that exists in L4T 28.X

        based systems to allow reverting to the old 28.x partition layout.


        Images that were releases on L4T 28.1, 28.2 etc did not support re-creating

        the partition layout in case of a rollback, because the new 32.X layout

        was not known at that point, and we were not aware that there could

        be situations in which connectivity problems could cause the system

        to roll back to an inconsistent state.


        We therefore fix this, so in case the new L4T 32.6 based OS encounters

        connectivity or engine related issues and rolls back, the updated hook

        in the old OS re-writes the partition layout in the corresponding 28.x format,

        with the offsets expected by the old tegra-bootloaders, thus allowing the

        system to fully revert to the old OS.

    - subject: Avoid MB1 bootloader debug mode
      hash: 8ddf7969dccda8746e880285be5b2d807b5808d0
      body: |
        In the current form, rollback-altboot from
        32.6.1 to 32.6.1 works on the AGX, however,
        if performed from 32.5.1 to the newer one,
        MB1 puts the device in debug mode instead
        of loading bootloaders from the old slot.

        The solution to this problem is to write
        both slots with 32.6.1 and just leave the
        kernel and kernel-dtb partitions on 32.5.1.

        This makes MB1 successfully load the inactive
        slots. For details see github link in this
        commit.

      body: |
        Starting with 32.6.1, when the device is provisioned, the
        flashing tools perform bpmp trimming by default, based on
        a value read from the device, which is 0. If however
        the files are signed without being written, the bpmp
        dtb is not trimmed and the boot blob is generated
        incorrectly (wrong offsets).
        Therefore we now tell the flashing tools to trim
        the bpmp dtb using the default ramcode, which is also 0,
        as the one that's being read from our device.

                ESR hostapps need special labels in order to be recognized. This allows

                to add those flags when creating the hostapp.

                Retrieves the last meta-balena version, which may not be the same as the

                last meta-balena tag.


                For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena branch is

                tagged with the ESR name, like 2.83.x, while the last meta-balena version

                will be a proper semver.

                Separating the build and release of blocks allows to use common code for

                block release.


                Also, pass a flag to specify whether the block should be deployed as final

                release.

                the signature in do_deploy:append. Re-deploying actually causes

                harm when chaining signatures, replacing a signed file with its

                unsigned counterpart.

                This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that we
                eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

                the name of the associated file.

              hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
              body: >
                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back. However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                but for the final version they are not and this should pull them

                Currently the two classes would keep the original files untouched and
                store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                Previously, the core service exposed a /proxy endpoint that would start

                up a proxy remotely, which would be used by a test in the connectivity

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as the same, passing

                        both of the to mkfifo, which lead to EINVAL errors when trying to create

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.


                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                The boot partition needs to be generated before creating the balenaos-img

                but is not part of the root filesystem generation.


                The decoupling allows to build just the docker rootfs image without

                having to build the balenaos-img target.

                by users or by power supplys when booting into the new OS,
                during HUP.

                When the limit is reached, u-boot will proceed to try

                The Rock Pi 4B uses a file named hw_intf.conf for
                enabling/disabling interfaces and for loading overlays.
                Just noting that the syntax is also slightly different
                from the config.txt file on RaspberryPi.

                Let's blacklist this file to avoid overriding
                it during an OS update.

                SUID or user namespacing to work. Disabling this feature on boards

                that previously enabled it necessitates container modifications and

                potentially breaks previously working applications.


                Create a distro feature to disable user namespacing by default in

                meta-balena, while allowing device types to keep it enabled to maintain

                compatibility with their original behavior.

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development images into

                a single image.

                The extlinux.conf file path in meta-balena is currently

                incorrect, let's update it's boot partition path so that

                BalenaHUP won't need to transfer the isolcpus setting to

                the new OS anymore. This is necessary only when updating from older

                OS versions in which the supervisor adds the isolcpus

                setting to the boot partition extlinux.conf file.

                        Some recent changes to the OS allowed some services to restart

                        automatically when the associated config files are changed.


                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to

                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

                        journal logs as


                        ```

                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```


                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

                        database should be side effect free.

                        environment

                        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.


                        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

                        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

                        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

                      hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19
                      body: >
                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                We no longer require reboots when changing hostname in config.json.

                The contents of '/etc/hostname' and the avahi mDNS broadcast hostname

                are updated automatically without requiring a reboot.

                Automatically update the system hostname when config.json changes.


                Changes to 'config.json' will trigger the 'balena-hostname' service

                to update the static and transient hostnames and the 'avahi'

                service to ensure that any hostname changes are broadcast via mDNS.

                This allows to re-use this functionality. Note that the `KERNEL_VERSION`

                variable is only available after the kernel has been built as it relies

                on get_kernelversion_headers() poky function and utsrelease.h being

                generated. This function parses the Makefile so only needs the source.

                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

              body: >
                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.

                introduced when images including 8227a61f6bef6d93cc6a5acd0ef93a2012079964

                made it to production.

                We can now use a runtime drop-in unit placed under /run/systemd/ to

                configure the balena-host service, which doesn't require us to remount

                the rootfs.

                is not possible. Symlinking /dev/null will break the services as well.

        where to place the configuration files.

                In recent kernels (i.e. 5.10.31 for Raspberry Pi) the

                arch/arm/kernel/module.lds file got moved. See

                https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/

                596b0474d3d9b1242eab713f84d8873f9887d980 for details.


                Hence we use in meta-balena-dunfell the upstream kernel-devsrc from the

                hardknott-3.3.1 Poky release which handles this module.lds move.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        Similarly when processing the destination layers to generate deltas we

                        only hold one reference at a time, leaving the subsequent layers

                        vulnerable to the same issues.

                Since we don't have devices using older 3.x kernels we update to a newer

                base image so that we don't have problems compiling this test kernel

                module on newer kernels.

                This avoids a compile error on kernel 5.10.31 on arm64

                raspberrypicm4-ioboard for example where it would complain _mcount is

                undefined because the older gcc in the intel-nuc-debian:stretch-20190717

                base image would not create the _mcount symbol when compiling against

                the newer 5.10.31 kernel.

                Resolve `latest` to dev variant


                If we want the serial logs of the DUT the image that is flashed needs to

                be the development variant. The `latest` shortcut however always

                resolves to the production image. We manually resolve the version to fix

                this.

                The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total BalenaOS

                size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB partitions. The

                data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage media.


                Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

                Add a new systemd service to check for full network connectivity.

                This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)

                connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the

                CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states. This

                service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be used

                to delay the start of other services which require full network

                access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems on

                networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.


                The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make sure

                that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is

                redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is started

                before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The initial

                check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the script

                standalone or post-boot.


                Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait for

                full network connectivity should add the following entries to their

                systemd unit definition:


                Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the engine

                unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in unit for

                reference.


                Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts those

                overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it would be

                possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without remounting

                the rootfs to be writeable.

              body: >
                The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update step

                when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the balena

                supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.


                This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a

                oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not exist

                in the new path before starting the supervisor.

                balena-engine requires fixes backported from upstream to support a newer

                version of Go, and retaining the new recipes while switching back to the

                supported version of Go using the GOVERSION variable is still a work in

                process. Revert these changes for now. We can merge the new recipes

                back in once the build issues are resolved.

              hash: ac0ba89f14c0b04b7353192f15a0634be44d910c
              body: >
                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet, and Go

                1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now to fix
                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update our

                build before upgrading further.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
                      body: >
                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a point it

                        can be used.

                        This extra info will mean the API is able to immediately set default

                        config vars based on the os/supervisor version so that they are

                        available on the first target state fetch rather than having a delay

                        whilst waiting for the supervisor to report them as part of a state

                        patch


                        Update balena-register-device from 6.1.6 to 7.2.0

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises

                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

        The upstream recipe has removed the master branch and replaced it with

        main. When specifying the SRC_URI with a sha1, the OE fetcher will assume

        the master branch and fail with:

                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run until we

                The other notable change is the fix for

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which allows

                `balena top` to work as expected on balenaOS

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

              hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2

                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded) and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state, requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely, skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition, and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases, such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub image

                without any external modules at all.

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead. This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

                GRUB builds modules with both debug and release variants, with *.module

                and *.mod extensions respectively.


                Install only the release modules in do_deploy() to avoid balooning the

                size of the boot partition.

              hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network interface

        Poky Dunfell is using Go v1.14 while meta-balena is still in v1.12. The

        -trimpath flag is introduced in v1.13 so we need to remove it from the

        build flags for the time being.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package compile properly:


                Removed is 0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
              body: >
                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into

                a separate procps package:


                - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                images, which don't contain a supervisor version, try to register

                in the API using the parameter supervisor_version='null'.


                However, the API expects this parameter to be unset completely if

                there's no version to be reported during registration, otherwise

                the call fails and the device doesn't show up in dashboard during

                flashing or report the post-provisioning state.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                returns to its original place, and these hooks copy the old database to the

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1 removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable. Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                        ```

                        version: '2.1'

                        services:
                          app_1:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_2:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_3:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                        ```


                        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database entries

                        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine handles this

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the removal process

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free` commands.

                        In order to make supervisor upgrades more transparent, lets move away

                        from this env var since it requires a container restart any time the supervisor

                        is upgraded. We should ultimately move towards providing the supervisors

                        set of capabilities, but that can come later

                        Due to the singleton work, when performing migration M00005 and there

                        are apps with services created in the database, a deadlock occurs

                        during database initialization due to a circular

                        dependency for generating scoped keys.

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API when in

                        managed mode.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                Drop the '-s' command line parameter from chronyd as:

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                b) restoring time from the RTC is already covered by the timeinit-rtc

                service.

                In order to produce sensible timestamps for journald log messages:

                a) the system time needs to be maintained correctly over a reboot, and

                b) the system time needs to be set before journald is started.


                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g. power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

                backend files to avoid the supervisor being forced to set the target state

                after HUP and reboot the device during the rollback period.


                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the only ones

                that force a reboot.

                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

                We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA key

                of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement support

                if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA bundle

                so that the CA is respected everywhere.

                        Due to switching to Alpine the ability to resolve mDNS
                        hostnames was lost. This patch overrides the lookup and
                        manually resolves the names.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

                                Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it only checks
                                for

                                existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine conditions in order

                                to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a completely separate

                                blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

                                a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

                In b791055f3f6ffd6cc5796569a7321c5060129eea I attempted to have flasher

                images report their preconfigured supervisor version without a good

                understanding of how flasher images work. As it turns out no supervisor

                information is maintained in the flasher image itself, so until that is

                sorted stop reporting a blank string for the supervisor version.

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files underneath
                it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt line is not

                connected.

                In order to get closer to formally requiring a target supervisor release

                in the model, we should expand our provisioning process to provide the

                initial supervisor_version metadata. This connects back to tri-app.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory, these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                When performing hostOS updates, the resin-logo.png might have

                been customized by the customer.

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the image

                are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started, otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the system.


                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                        true or false, controlling the state of the avahi service. This

                        determines if the device advertises it's presence over mDNS.

                          by Balena is allowed.

                        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API
                        introduced

                        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.


                        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of

                        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.

                        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go


                        Background on the composefile implementation:

                        This is part of the work to make the application-manager module much

                        less monolithic, in preperation for system apps and more generally

                        multi-app.

                        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but still having to
                        pass

                        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db module and have

                        access to the database handle.

                This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory or 1GB,

                whichever smallest.


                Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in warrior, and a

                new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in BalenaOS as

                we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS. The

                mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev database

                is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not detected

                by systemd.


                This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common to all

                the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the initramfs that

                creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that enables it.

              body: >
                When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is a

                pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool

                URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server' and

                'burst' commands.


                To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into the

                'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this

                option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been present

                since v1.25 released in 2011.


                This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command line

                running on a RPi3.

                > When a pool source is unreachable, marked as a falseticker, or has a distance larger than the limit set by the maxdistance directive, chronyd will try to replace the source with a newly resolved address from the pool.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not there.


                This commit switches to use /tmp to store the new UUID for the root partition on

                first boot after generating new UUIDs.

                rust is used for various utilities in the OS.

                e.g. os-config, healthdog, bindmount, some others maybe


                At the moment, we haven't syncronized on one rust version and device

                integration layers can pick any meta-rust version. Which probably uses

                the latest rust version in the layer.


                Lets sync on 1.36 and move in steps when needed.

                        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that

                        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by

                        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to

                        provide nested-changelogs.

                        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and

                        is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.


                        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in

                        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just

                        being explicit about it.

                        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken

                        sync-debug.js.


                        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process

                        with the supervisor on a device.

                        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long with

                        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation tools

                        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


                        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and were

                        only to enable livepush builds.

              body: >
                When a partition filesystem label is detected, udev checks whether the

                device belongs to the same disk as the root partitition passed in the

                kernel command line by the bootloader. Only if it does, it creates a by-state

                link to it.


                By using this by-state links we avoid filesystem label clashes as the

                system will always use partitions in the same drive as root (as

                instructed by the bootloader who is the source of truth).

                ppp version is 2.4.7. Without defining the right path, the path defaults

                Lets pass it here to keep it correct.


                Should not have any actual affect. NM plugin was built with reference

                to the 2.4.7 headers. Just the directoy path would say 2.4.5 misleading

                We also delete the patch that switched the 12d1:1f01 modems to
                NCM mode with that specific MessageContent because that made
                other Huawei modems that used the same vid:pid combination
                unusable in that mode. So now these modems will work in the old
                Hilink mode using cdc_ether instead.

                Some devices have special tools in the initramfs that bloat it.

                e.g. Jetson family have tegra-firmware-xusb etc.


                IMAGE_ROOTFS_MAXSIZE triggers an error if the rootfs goes beyond this

                limit. This does not force the rootfs to an empty fixed size.


                We can comfortably increase the max size to 32MB to reduce unnecessary

                patches in the device integration layers.


                We'll still be covered by the full resin-rootA size limit.

              body: >
                The DNS clients (applications) resolver libraries use the timeout value in

                /etc/resolv.conf to set the time between DNS attempts. The default is 5

                secs which for slow networks like cellular mean lots of DNS requests on

                a bandwidth sensitive channel.


                This change modifies the default to 15 secs. This timeout only applies

                when DNS servers are unresponsive so it will not affect the normal

                functionality.

                This commit increases the default NTP poll rate to around 4.5 hours.


                BalenaOS uses chronyd for time synchronization, and it allows to specify

                a minpoll and maxpoll values per server with a power of two number of

                seconds for the minimum and maximum polling time respectively.


                With those constraints, the change set both limits to 2^14s (4.55h) for

                all servers.


                An architectural decision has been made not to make this configurable.


                Fixes #1780.

                It is better to use fdisk to check that an internal media
                is a suitable block device rather than using the shell
                internal block testing feature. This is because there is
                at least a case when the kernel lists an ASMT 2115 controller
                as /dev/sda but that is not an actual drive so it cannot be
                written to and the flashing procedure will error out.

                We inherit do_populate_lic_deploy from poky. It uses IMAGE_NAME

                which includes DATETIME


                DATETIME changes between runs so we can sometimes get into a state

                where the do_populate_lic_deploy task has its stamp file set.


                But when our subsequent deploy_image_license_manifest task runs, the

                DATETIME is different. Hence we get into a state where we have to

                run cleanall on the resin-image-flasher recipe to clean up directories.


                Lets mark do_populate_lic_deploy with nostamp. This should make it

                run every time we need to run deploy_image_license_manifest with the

                most up to date DATETIME variable to prevent any hiccups

            - subject: Make uboot dev images autoboot delay build time configurable. Default
                is no delay
              hash: ff9e5c26ce7caa694725d7009943db0713655be6

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                We would just check for the existence of console=null in kernel cmdline


                A better way would be to check the presence of a valid symlink for fd0,

                fd1 and fd2. And assign them to /dev/null if unavailable.

                The default driver is cgroupfs. We switch to systemd so that there is

                one cgroup manager in our OS.


                Otherwise, systemd will have its own cgroup manager and cgroupfs will

                be another cgroup manager via balenaEngine daemon.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is reasonable.

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                We'd like to split dev and prod uboot config fragments. Dev images can

                have a 2 second u-boot delay to facilitate debugging. While prod images

                shouldn't really pause at this stage of the boot.

                We'd like to enable some config options for all devices via meta-balena


                The support is mainline since warrior. Lets copy it in meta-balena

                to get it in the previous layers as well.


                We need CMD_SETEXPR to be enabled for rollbacks to work. So enable it

                via the config fragment

            - subject: Devices using u-boot. Enable rollback-altboot by handling bootcount via
                meta-balena.
              hash: aa0a389ea92a71123813f291833fea61f4965164

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

            - subject: Production Devices using u-boot. Enable CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY to reset

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application container

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                Fixes #1564


                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release. After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now with

                both cases.

                Poky, following os-release(5), sanitizes VERSION_ID accordingly but in

                doing so it produces a nonisemver compliant version. For example:

                    VERSION="2.37.0+rev1"
                    VERSION_ID="2.37.0-rev1"

                This patch reverts that to make sure rev is a build tag.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device: disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to
